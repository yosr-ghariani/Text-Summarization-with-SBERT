# Text Summerization with SBERT

This project consists of:

1. a Python notebook that utilizes the pre-trained model from the **Sentence-Transformers** library, specifically the *all-MiniLM-L6-v2* model.
2. a dataset folder containing 50 JSON files with data related to reproductive medicine.

The python notebook includes all of the following steps:

* Data Preprocessing
* Model Implementation
* Training
* Evaluation
* Saving the Model

# Setup
