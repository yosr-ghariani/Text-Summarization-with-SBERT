In its advanced stages, the disease imitates malignancy, not in terms of histology but by its clinical course.The unclear etiology and lack of effective medical therapy make adenomyosis a challenging clinical disorder.It is clear, however, that estrogen is essential for the growth of ectopic endometrium outside the uterus (, ) .Therefore, medical strategies blocking ovarian steroidogenesis and local estrogen synthesis by the aromatase enzyme represent an indispensable option for treatment () .However, the majority of patients require hysterectomy (, ) , which is a radical treatment but not an appropriate option for women who desire pregnancy. Adenomyosis once was seen as a disease of parous women that could be diagnosed only by surgical resection and pathological examination () .However, advancements in high-resolution imaging now allow for noninvasive diagnosis by magnetic resonance imaging or transvaginal ultrasound (, ) .Ultrasound features of the adenomyotic uterus include an enlarged uterus, asymmetry of the myometrial thickness, a poorly defined endomyometrial junction, and heterogeneously hypoechoic myometrium () .Development of noninvasive diagnostic techniques also revealed a higher prevalence of adenomyosis in infertile women (, ) ; suggested mechanisms underlying uterine factor infertility include abnormal decidualization resulting in impaired endometrial receptivity, altered peristalsis of the uterus, and disruption of the endomyometrial junction (, ) .Alterations in the immune system linked to sex steroid hormone changes and epithelial mesenchymal transition in women with adenomyosis may promote inflammation and impair fertility () .Some studies have shown that adenomyosis is associated not only with infertility but also increased risk of miscarriage (, ) . Recent research has led to new insights into the molecular pathophysiology of adenomyosis.Evidence from nextgeneration screening-based studies identified KRAS mutations in endometrial epithelial cell clones and adjacent adenomyotic tissue (, ) .These activating KRAS mutations, which also have been found in endometriosis, are one of the most frequent driver mutations in malignancies, such as lung, pancreatic, and colorectal cancers () .KRAS mutations in adenomyosis and endometriosis are confined to endometrial epithelial cells and associated with specific pathways that increase cell survival and proliferation () .These mutations also have been associated with progesterone resistance in adenomyosis () .The findings of next-generation screening-based studies favor mechanisms involving invagination of mutated cells rather than metaplasia or differentiation of progenitor cells; however, more work is needed to understand gene expression in the extremely heterogeneous adenomyotic cell populations and cross talk with surrounding tissues. The histologically complex nature of adenomyosis, with island-like structures inside the myometrium that also contain endometrial and myometrial cells, makes it difficult to identify pathophysiologic mechanisms based on the average gene expression of the whole tissue because of the background noise or dilution issues.Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has opened a new era in research that enables investigators to reveal the heterogeneity in complex tissues and understand how distinct cell types contribute to disease () .In a recent study, scRNA-seq of endometrial tissues collected throughout the menstrual cycle from healthy women revealed cell types based on the transcriptomic profile of epithelial cells and stromal fibroblasts during major phases of endometrial transformation () .Here, we applied scRNA-seq to analyze the cellular composition and transcriptomic profiles of matched tissues of endometrium, normal myometrium, and adenomyosis from the same hysterectomy specimens collected from women, with the goal of identifying specific signaling pathways and cell-cell interactions in the adenomyotic uterus that contribute to this complex disease. Northwestern University's institutional review board approved the use of human tissue for this study.After obtaining written informed consent, adenomyotic tissue and adjacent normal endometrium and normal myometrium were obtained from premenopausal women undergoing hysterectomy for adenomyosis.Three samples were collected from each patient, for a total of samples from patients.Briefly, after hysterectomy, samples from each hysterectomy specimen were dissected by a senior pathologist immediately and confirmed histologically using hematoxylin and eosin staining.Normal-appearing endometrial and myometrial samples were obtained at cm from adenomyotic tissue.For normalappearing endometrium we obtained a full thickness section of endometrial tissue that included functionalis and basalis layers.After tissue dissection and digestion as described below, single-cell suspensions were submitted for scRNAseq in the Northwestern University NUSeq Core (Fig. A ).The age range of the patients was - years and each patient had at least previous delivery.No patient had been receiving hormonal treatment at the time of tissue collection for a period of at least months preoperatively.All tissues were collected during the follicular phase.The cycle phase was determined based on last menstrual period and histology.All patients had diagnoses of diffuse adenomyosis confirmed by pathology reports. Adenomyotic, endometrial, and myometrial tissues were dissociated and cells were isolated using a previously described protocol () .Briefly, tissues were digested or frozen within hours after hysterectomy.Samples from patients ( samples) were processed fresh.The remaining patient's samples ( samples) were frozen due to lack of available appointments in the Northwestern University NUSeq Core.For the fresh samples, tissues were kept in HypoThermosol FRS Solution (BioLife Solutions, Bothell, WA) for up to hours.Tissues were minced into very small pieces in a petri dish with Hank's balanced salt solution, then placed in a mL Falcon tube with digestion enzyme mixture (collagenase, protease, DNase, hyaluronidase, and calcium chloride) in mL Hank's balanced salt solution.Tissues were incubated for hours in a C bead bad incubator with minutes of gentle shaking every minutes.After enzymatic and mechanical digestion, the tissue fraction was allowed to sediment out (approximately - minutes).The stromal cells and smooth muscle cells were collected by passing the digested supernatant through -mm cell sieves and debris was left in the filter.Red blood cell lysis was performed for the stromal cell fraction.For adenomyotic and endometrial tissues, the epithelial cell pellets were backwashed by inverting the cell strainer and centrifugation.The supernatant was removed, and epithelial cells were digested further with mL TrypLE express enzyme (Gibco, Billings, MNT) at C for minutes, followed by passing through -mm cell sieves to obtain single epithelial cell suspensions.Epithelial and stroma cell suspensions were centrifuged at relative centrifugal force for minutes at room temperature.After removing the supernatant without disrupting the pellet, stromal and epithelial cells were suspended and mixed together in \\u00c2 phosphate-buffered saline with .% bovine serum albumin ( mg/mL) to achieve the target cell concentration (< million cells per tube in mL washing solution in mL DNA LoBind Tubes).Epithelial cell digestion steps were skipped for normal myometrium tissue because significant numbers of epithelial cells were expected in the sample.For all tissue types, to remove the remaining cell debris and large clumps, the cell suspension was pipetted gently and filtered with Scienceware mm Flowm Tip strainers (VWR, Radnor, PA).For frozen samples, the tissue was minced into very small pieces immediately after collection from the pathology core and split into cryovials containing Cryostor CS Freeze media (BioLife Solutions).Before scRNA-seq, frozen samples were thawed in a C bath for minute and digested to obtain single-cell suspensions, as described above. Single-cell suspensions of each tissue in DNA LoBind tubes were placed on ice and submitted to the NUSeq Core immediately to check the viability and cell number.Cell yield and viability of the frozen and thawed samples and fresh samples were comparable and >%, as determined by the trypan blue cell viability assay.From the samples, a total of approximately , cells were collected.After checking for sample quality and filtering out dead cells, the final total cell number was ,.Overall, the contribution from each of the patients to cell clusters was comparable in terms of total cell numbers.However, we noted that each patient sample contributed variably to cell clusters in endometrial and adenomyotic issues.The contribution came primarily from a single patient in extremely small clusters: endometrial clusters (progenitor and T-cell) and adenomyotic cluster (neuron-like).Data from these clusters were excluded from our analyses.Due to high cell yield, suspensions were diluted before sequencing to obtain the target cell concentration.Single-cell suspensions from adenomyotic uteri with approximately % cell viability was used as input material with an optimal cell concentration of - cells/mL.Samples then were processed for construction of \\u00c2 libraries for sequencing using the \\u00c2 Genomics Single-Cell reagent kit protocol.Samples were loaded onto the \\u00c2 Genomics Chromium platform to generate single-cell gel beads in emulsion.Cells underwent reverse transcription reactions to generate barcoded cDNA, which shares a \\u00c2 barcode with all cDNA from its individual cell of origin.Subsequently, the gel beads in emulsion were broken, and all uniquely barcoded cDNAs were pooled and amplified by polymerase chain reaction to generate material for sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq at a depth of average , reads per cell. Pre-processing and integration.Processed data from the Cell Ranger pipeline was analyzed using the R package Seurat (v.) as described previously () .Quality control analysis was performed before data integration.Cells with % gene counts and cells with >% mitochondrial RNA content were filtered out to remove low-quality cells.After log normalization of the filtered data from the patients, data were aligned using the FindIntegrationAnchors and Integra-teData functions to remove batch effects.This process was performed for data from adenomyosis, endometrium, and myometrium samples separately to identify and compare tissue-specific cell types. Cell clustering, visualization, and cell-type annotation.After scaling with a coefficient and regressing out the effects of mitochondrial genes and the cell cycle effect (S Scores and iG Scores), principal component analysis was performed with principal components and a default resolution parameter using the FindCluster function.Identified cell clusters were visualized by a nonlinear dimensionality reduction algorithm, UMAP.To identify the cell type of each cluster, canonical cell marker gene information was collected from the published Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of adenomyosis tissue.(A) UMAP presentation of adenomyotic cell clusters.There is a larger and more heterogeneous group of fibroblast-like cells than endometrial fibroblasts (see Fig. ).In contrast to endometrial tissue, there is no readily recognizable connection between the pericyte progenitors and fibroblast-like cells.(B) Fibroblasts comprised a much larger portion (%) of adenomyosis, compared with endometrial fibroblast population (%, see Fig. ).In contrast, epithelial cells made up only % of adenomyosis versus % of endometrial tissue (see Fig. literature, then marker genes for every cluster were identified using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test option of the FindAll-Markers function, and clusters were annotated based on the presence of reference marker genes in these clusters. Pseudotime, DoRothEA, PROGENy, and gene enrichment analyses.After transferring Seurat-generated cluster embeddings into a monocle object, pseudotime analysis was performed on the fibroblast-like cell clusters using monocle (v..) () .Transcription factor (TF) enrichment analysis was performed on fibroblast-like cell clusters of all tissues using the discriminant regulon expression analysis tool, DoRo-thEA (v), which is a curated resource of TFs and their transcriptional targets () .First, regulons with A-C confidence level were selected for the analysis, then the most variable TFs in selected clusters were visualized.Pathway activities of selected clusters were estimated by PROGENy, which infers pathway activity from perturbation experiments () .Gene ontology terms for differentially upregulated genes in unciliated epithelial cells in adenomyosis and endometrium samples were identified using cluster Profiler on Gene Set Enrichment Analysis using the gseGO function for all ontologies.Normalized enrichment scores were calculated for enrichment after correcting for multiple testing with the Benjamini-Hochberg method.Dot plots were generated to show significant GO terms based on their p-adjusted value and Gene Ratio, derived by dividing the total number of genes in the gene set by the number of overlapping genes.In these pathway analyses, we excluded the clusters that originated primarily from the tissue of from a single patient; i.e., E and E from endometrium and A from adenomyosis (see Figs. E, C ). We identified cell clusters comprised of distinct cell types shown in the UMAP: unciliated ( clusters) and ciliated epithelial cells, endothelial cells ( clusters), fibroblast-like cells ( clusters), activated fibroblasts, pericytes, vascular smooth muscle cells, NK cells, T cells ( clusters), B cells, macrophages, monocytes, and potential progenitor cells (Fig. B ) The top markers for each cell type are shown in a dot blot (Fig. C ), and the top markers for each cluster are shown in a detailed heatmap (Supplemental Fig. a ). Unciliated epithelial cells organized in clusters (E, E, E) comprised % of the endometrium.Epithelial cells were identified with canonical markers including EPCAM, PAEP, MMP, and KRT.We also identified one ciliated epithelial cell cluster, which expresses cilia-associated genes (C), such as RSPH, AGR, and PIFO; this cell type was described recently in a study performing scRNA-seq of normal endometrium (; Figs. B-D ). Endothelial cells expressed PECAM, SOX and CLDN and were present in clusters (E, E, E), which constituted % of endometrium (Figs. B-D ). Immune cells constituted of % of endometrium.The dominant immune cells were NK cells (%) expressing NKG and GNLY) and T cells (%) expressing CDD and CD.Macrophages and monocytes were identified based on CD and HLA-DRA expression.A very small B cell cluster also was present (%), which expressed CDA and IGKC (Figs. B-D ). Fibroblast-like cells constituted the majority of the endometrium (%).We identified closely grouped clusters of fibroblast-like cells (E, E, E, E), which express collagen and matrix-related genes (Figs. B-D ).When comparing endometrial tissues across the patients, all tissues contained the majority of cellular clusters, although at varying levels (Fig. E ). Fibroblast clusters E and E had similar gene expression profiles, with both expressing SFRP, COLA, LUM, MMP, SFRP, ECM, and IGF (Fig. F ).Feature plots also revealed that both clusters also expressed MME, ESR, and PGR, which are expressed by endometrial stromal fibroblasts (Fig. G ).Cluster E showed high expression of adhesion-related genes, such as WISP, CCDC, GSN, OGN, and SERPINF.Cluster E was slightly segregated from the group and uniquely expressed differentiation and mitogenesis-related genes, such as FOSB, EGR, NRA, FOS, RO RB, THBS, ESR, JUN, and PDGFRA.Among all fibroblast-like cells, ESR expression was the highest in cluster E, which we identified as differentiated fibroblasts.Some of the key genes expressed in the fibroblast-like populations are shown as feature plots in Figures F and G . A distinct cluster (E) that closely mapped to fibroblasts showed unique expression of the pericyte markers COXI, MCAM, NOTCH, and PDGFRB.Attached to E was a vascular smooth muscle cell cluster (E) expressing markers, such as MYL, TINAGL, BCAM, MYH, MYLK, and ACTA (Fig. F ).Because stem/progenitor type cells were detected consistently among pericytes, we performed a pseudotime analysis starting from cluster E () .Intriguingly, the differentiation trajectory initiating from pericytes progressed through fibroblast-like cells in E and E, then through actively differentiating fibroblast-like cells (E) and ended in ciliated epithelium (E; Fig. H ).Endometrial mesenchymal stem cells were reported previously to be clonogenic and multipotent pericytes, which may respond to conditions during endometrial regeneration () .Therefore, our findings suggest that fibroblast-like cells might originate from pericytes with mesenchymal stem cell characteristics.The scRNA-seq data also suggested that ciliated epithelial cells may be derived from pericytes through mesenchymalepithelial transition (MET; Fig. H ).The PROGENy analysis of this MET trajectory showed that distinct signaling pathways, namely PIK and P, were upregulated in differentiated fibroblast-like cells (E) and the ciliated epithelial cluster (E), respectively (Fig. I ).We also used DoRothEA to examine differential expression of TFs in MET differentiation trajectories (E/E/E/E/E), which is detailed in Supplemental Fig. b (available online). We identified clusters including cell types in adenomyotic tissue, as shown in UMAP (Fig. A ).Compared with endometrium, adenomyotic tissue had a higher proportion of fibroblasts and lower proportion of epithelial cells.Fibroblastlike cells constituted % of the tissue and showed a high degree of heterogeneity, gathering in distinct clusters (A, A, A, A, A, A).A smooth muscle cell cluster (A), which closely grouped with the fibroblast populations, constituted % of adenomyotic tissue.Epithelial cells constituted % of the tissue including ciliated and unciliated epithelium (A, A; Figs. A, B ).Unlike endometrium, we identified a small neuron-like cluster (A) grouped with fibroblast-like cells and a cluster with myeloid progenitor cells grouped with mast cells (A).The relative contributions of each cluster per patient and the top gene markers for each cell type are shown in Figures C and D and Supplemental Figure a (available online).Immune cells constituted % of adenomyosis, compared with % in endometrium.Macrophages and monocytes constituted % of cells in adenomyotic tissue followed by T cells (%) and NK cells (%).Endothelial cells constituted approximately % of the tissue (A, A, A), with a small cluster including lymphatic endothelial cells (A).In contrast with endometrium, pericytes (A) and vascular smooth muscle cells (A) clustered separately from the fibroblast-like cells.Similar to the endometrium, we identified a potential progenitor cell cluster (A), which associated closely with fibroblast-like cells and constituted % of adenomyotic tissue (Figs. A, B ). The fibroblast-like clusters A, A, A, A and A showed transcriptomic similarities and represented a group distinct from A, which was uniquely enriched in smooth muscle cell markers, and A that had a strong signature for extracellular matrix-related genes (Fig. E ).In A, a TF analysis demonstrated increased activity of ESR, ETS, FLI, and FOXL (Supplemental Fig. b ), whereas PROGENy showed activation of the MAPK and EGFR pathways, both of which are associated with cell proliferation (Fig. H ).The neighboring A cluster had high expression of PDGFRA, COLA, MME, ESR, RORB and HAND, classical markers for mesenchymal progenitors as well as endometrial stromal cells (Fig. E ).The PDGFRA together with ESR genes were expressed in A, suggestive of actively proliferating and differentiating mesenchymal cells driven by estrogen.Interestingly, A showed a pattern of maximum ESR expression indicative of high estrogen responsiveness, whereas the highest PGR expression was seen in A and A (Fig. F ).This pattern of progression of ESR/PGR expression is consistent with a pseudotime analysis showing differentiation in the direction of A/A/A/A (Figs. F, G ).The TF analysis suggested that A and A have increased ATF activity, which is related to cellular response to injury, and A showed MXI and THAP upregulation, which are related with pluripotency and mesenchymal cell differentiation (Supplemental Fig. b ). Cluster A showed clear expression of smooth muscle cell markers, such as ACTA, DES, ACTG, and MYLK; therefore, we identified it as the smooth muscle cells (SMCs) cluster (Fig. E ).Pseudotime analysis suggested that this SMC cluster seems to originate from an adenomyotic fibroblast cluster after a differentiation pattern of A/A/A/A/A (Fig. G ).The TF analysis of A showed high activity of MEFA, TEAD, and SMAD, which are associated with EMT regulation and muscle hypertrophy.Matrix gla protein (MGP) was the top marker in A; these cells showed high expression of genes associated with matrix remodeling including decorin (DCN), which is a collagen binding proteoglycan of extracellular matrix, asporin (ASPN), which has a key role in osteoblast driven collagen mineralization activity, and other genes related to macrophage response, such as AEBP.The TFs associated with immune response (STAT, SPI) and muscle hypertrophy (SMAD), and the related TNF and NFKB pathways, were predicted to be activated in this cluster (Supplemental Fig. b ).The MGP-expressing A cluster may represent terminally differentiated fibroblasts that are resident in adenomyosis. In the fibroblast-like cell population, the pseudotime analysis initiated from A showed a pro-proliferative transcriptomic profile similar to that of the small progenitor cluster (A, Fig. E ); the differentiation trajectory diffusely transitioned via A, A, A, and A, and segregated to reach clear end points, namely A (SMCs) and A (fibroblast-like cells expressing matrix-associated genes including MGP, thus designated MGP fibroblast-like; Fig. G ).Intriguingly, this analysis also demonstrated a trajectory between the small progenitor cluster (A) and the entire congregated fibroblast-like population (Fig. G ).A expressed mitosis and cell division-associated genes and was closely related transcriptomically to the progenitor cluster E in endometrium.Fibroblast-like cells were clustered tightly in adenomyosis, and unlike endometrial tissue, pericytes (A) and vascular SMCs (A) were not linked directly to this fibroblast-like population (Figs. B, A ).A pseudotime analysis starting from pericytes did not show a continuation to fibroblast-like cells in adenomyotic tissue. Overall, there were clusters including cell types in myometrium (Supplemental Fig. a , available online).As in endometrium and adenomyosis, the dominant cell type in myometrium comprised closely bundled fibroblast-like cell clusters (%), followed by SMCs (%; Supplemental Fig. b ).Intriguingly, there were small clusters of epithelial cells (<%) in myometrium (M, M) and clusters of endothelial cells (M, M, M) including a lymphatic endothelial cell cluster (M).Similar to endometrium and adenomyosis, pericytes (M) and vascular SMCs (M, M) clustered together.T cells made up the dominant immune cell cluster, similar to endometrium, followed by macrophages and monocytes.Relative contributions of clusters by each patient are shown in (Supplemental Fig. c ). The fibroblast-like cells in myometrial tissue were comprised of a close group of clusters (M, M, M, M, M).We performed subcluster analysis on these groups, as demonstrated in a heatmap (Supplemental Fig. d ).The OGN, CTGF, CYR, and LUM genes were the top markers in M; these genes are associated with collagen formation and remodeling () () () .Cluster M showed similarity to M, which uniquely expressed MGP and was designated a ''MGP fibroblast-like'' cluster, similar to A (Fig. E ).Cluster M also showed high expression of matrix-associated proteins, such as gelsolin (GSN), decorin (DCN), and fibulin- (FBLN) () . Fibroblast clusters M and M had high expression of MMP, SFRP, CRABP, and VCAN; however, unlike M, M also showed upregulation of WNT, ECM, and COLA as well as retinoic acid metabolism-associated genes, such as ALDHA, RORB, and RBP ().The MDK gene, another highly expressed gene in M, encodes a protein that responds to retinoic acid and promotes cell survival, migration, and tumorigenesis () .Cluster M was distinct from all other clusters and showed a unique gene expression profile of differentiation and early response genes, such as FOS, JUN, and EGR () .The PROGENy analysis showed upregulation of hypoxia, TGFB, P, NFkB, TNF, and JAK-STAT pathways in M (MGP fibroblast-like cells), similar to A in adenomyosis (Supplemental Fig. e and Fig. H ).A pseudotime analysis originating from the myometrial fibroblast cluster M showed a differentiation map through M and M that ended in M (MGP fibroblast-like cells; Supplemental Fig. f ), similar to adenomyosis fibroblasts (Fig. G ).Cluster-specific markers and a list of regulatory TFs in fibroblast-like cell clusters in myometrium are shown in a detailed heatmap (Supplemental Figs. a, b , available online). We also interrogated the similarities and the differences between the SMC clusters M and M and the SMC cluster (A) in adenomyosis (Supplemental Fig. c ).The transcriptomic profiles of M and A are quite similar with high expression of SFRP, a modulator of the WNT pathway (Supplemental Fig. c ).These data collectively suggest that in myometrial and adenomyotic tissues, SMCs likely originate from a fibroblast-like cluster. We next evaluated differential gene expression patterns in fibroblast clusters that distinguish adenomyosis from endometrium and myometrium (Figs. A, B ).Among the fibroblast-like clusters in adenomyosis and endometrium, the most striking observation was that A is very similar to E and E endometrial fibroblasts (Fig. A ).This suggested that A fibroblasts represent a population that migrated from endometrium to invade myometrial tissue and contributed to adenomyosis (see Figs. B, A ).Pseudotime analyses suggested that A, E, and E all have progenitor-like features, from which more differentiated fibroblasts originate (see Figs. H, G ). When adenomyotic and myometrial fibroblast clusters were compared (Fig. B ), A showed striking similarities to M and M, all of which expressed the highest levels of MGP and seemed to represent a terminally differentiated population among the fibroblast-like clusters in each tissue (see Fig. G and Supplemental Fig. f ).The MGP is a structural extracellular matrix constituent () , and our finding resonates with the observed increase in extracellular matrix in adenomyotic tissue. Intriguingly, the gene family SFRP, which are modulators of the WNT pathway, were expressed prominently in fibroblast-like clusters, showing cross-tissue similarities between the endometrium, adenomyosis, and myometrium (Figs. A, B ).Therefore, we first determined the differential expression of the members of this gene family across the tissues (Fig. C ).Both SFRP and SFRP levels were higher in adenomyosis than in endometrium or myometrium (Fig. C ).Gene SFRP was expressed only in adenomyosis and myometrium (A, M; Figs. A-C ).It has been reported that SFRP, which is a WNT antagonist, downregulates estrogen-dependent b-catenin activity, inhibits cell growth, and promotes myogenesis () .The lack of SFRP expression in endometrium might permit epithelial cell growth and invasiveness.Thus, SFRP might be a key predictive marker of epithelial cell growth potential in adenomyosis.Interestingly, SFRP and SFRP are expressed in all fibroblast-like clusters in adenomyosis, whereas SFRP is expressed only in A (Fig. D ). The cells in clusters A, A, A, and A seemed to be distinct within adenomyotic tissue (Figs. A, B ); analysis of adenomyotic fibroblast-like cells showed uniquely upregulated genes involved in the WNT pathway, ribosome biogenesis, and protein targeting to endoplasmic reticulum (Supplemental Fig. , available online).Expression of genes in the ribosome biogenesis pathway was strikingly prominent in A.Ribosome biogenesis is an established pathway that supports tumor cell growth and proliferation () . The epithelium represents the defining cell type in adenomyosis, and adenomyosis is thought to originate from the endometrium.Therefore, we further analyzed differentially expressed genes in epithelial cells between matched adenomyotic tissue and endometrium () .First, we used scatter plot analysis to define the ciliated and unciliated epithelial cells in our tissues (Fig. A ).As expected, classical markers, such as PAEP and MMP, were conspicuously higher in unciliated epithelial cells, whereas a much larger number of genes were prominently expressed in ciliated epithelial cells (Fig. A ) () .Then, we identified differentially expressed genes separately in unciliated and ciliated epithelia in adenomyosis and endometrium (Figs. B, C ).In general, unciliated and ciliated epithelium in adenomyotic tissue and endometrium showed similar transcriptomic profiles.In unciliated epithelium, however, expression of a number of genes was significantly higher in endometrium, including markers of differentiation, such as PAEP, PLCG, HSPAA, and HSPAA (Fig. B ).The PAEP marker, also known as glycodelin, is a secretory glycoprotein that is regulated by progesterone and associated with differentiation and healthy implantation (, ) .This finding may suggest the presence of progesterone resistance in adenomyotic unciliated epithelium (, ) .In unciliated and ciliated epithelial cells, expression of heat shock proteins (HSPAA, HSPAA) was significantly lower in adenomyosis than in endometrium (Figs. B, C ).Because some heat shock proteins are important for estrogen action, which seems to have a role in adenomyosis () , this finding requires further investigation. We also noted that immune function-related genes and pathways are upregulated in unciliated epithelial cells of adenomyosis compared with endometrium (Figs. B, D ).Expression of genes associated with immune response and macrophage activation, such as HLA-DRA, HLA-DRB, CD, NFKBIA, and SA, were significantly higher in adenomyotic epithelium (Fig. B ).These genes also are related to cell proliferation, inflammation, and cell motility.Among the upregulated pathways in adenomyosis, immune response-related processes were significantly upregulated in adenomyosis in ciliated and unciliated epithelium (Fig. D ).Moreover, genes involved in the canonical WNT signaling pathway and regulation of epithelial cell migration pathways were upregulated only in adenomyotic unciliated epithelium. In our analysis, WNT signaling emerged as a prominent biological process that was differentially regulated in stromal, epithelial, and SMCs; thus, we performed bioinformatics to further analyze paracrine and intracrine WNT-related interactions between all cell types in adenomyotic tissue (cellcell communication analysis, Fig. E ) The WNT signaling network analysis identified multiple signals originating from fibroblast clusters A, A, A, and A toward epithelial and endothelial clusters A, A, A, and A (Fig. E ).The directionality of signals from stromal cells toward endothelial and epithelial cells is supported by the distribution of expression of ligands (WNT) and their receptors (FZD and LRP) in each cluster (Fig. F ).In particular, WNT and WNT were expressed prominently in adenomyosis-specific fibroblastlike clusters, such as A, A, A, and A (Fig. F ; see Fig. ).The most prominent WNT receptors expressed in endothelial or epithelial cells were FZD and LRP.In summary, our scRNA-seq analysis uncovered significant roles of various fibroblast populations in endometrium and adenomyosis that seem to have central roles in adenomyosis pathophysiology via WNT signaling to endothelial and epithelial cells. To our knowledge, this is the first detailed characterization of the transcriptomic landscape of the adenomyotic uterus using scRNA-seq to compare gene expression in distinct cell types of matched endometrium, adenomyotic tissue, and myometrium.We identified ciliated and unciliated epithelial cells, fibroblast-like cells, SMCs, endothelial cells, pericytes, vascular SMCs, potential progenitor cells, T cells, NK cells, B cells, macrophages, and monocytes, as well as small clusters including neurons and myeloid progenitors in the adenomyotic uterus.Our analyses revealed a high degree of heterogeneity in fibroblast-like cells in the adenomyotic uterus.This heterogeneity may be due to different transcriptional states driven by inflammation and fibrosis in adenomyosis.We identified fibroblast-like cell clusters that we suspect represent a disease-specific transcriptome (A, A, A, and A; Figs. A, B ). The pathophysiology of adenomyosis has been debated; however, current evidence suggests that adenomyosis occurs after the invasion of the myometrium by cellular oligoclones comprised of deep glandular epithelial cells with KRAS mutations together with attached endometrial stromal cells (, ) .The lack of a substantial difference between epithelial cells in adenomyotic tissue and endometrium in our study supports this theory.Progesterone resistance has been demonstrated in adenomyotic tissue; Inuoe et al. () linked progesterone resistance to autonomously activated KRAS.Overall progesterone receptor (PGR) levels have been reported to be lower in adenomyosis compared to normal endometrium () ; however, we here identified higher PGR expression in distinct populations of fibroblast-like cells in adenomyotic tissue than in endometrium and myometrium, suggesting that progesterone resistance at the level of stromal cells is mediated by complex cellular and molecular mechanisms (Supplemental Fig. , available online).On the other hand, epithelial cells in adenomyotic tissue showed downregulation of PAEP compared with epithelial cells in endometrium; PAEP is an important progesterone-responsive gene (, ) .This is suggestive that progesterone action in the context of a stromal-epithelial paracrine interaction may be deficient in adenomyosis (, ) . The first study comparing eutopic endometrial tissues of women with or without adenomyosis identified differentially expressed genes, which might initiate the disease pathways including eukaryotic initiation factor signaling, oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and estrogen receptor signaling () .This study was based on microarray analysis and suggested that these abnormalities might be associated with the invasion of myometrial tissue by endometrial cells () .A more recent study used bulk RNA sequencing to identify differentially expressed genes and molecular pathways in the eutopic endometrium from adenomyosis patients () .These investigators found that IL- and ERK/MAPKrelated pathways were activated in the eutopic endometrium of adenomyotic uterine tissues () .A different study also identified the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway in association with the proliferation of uterine SMCs in women with adenomyosis () . The WNT pathway has been studied in the pathophysiology of adenomyosis (); however, cell-specific details of its role have not been well understood.Here, we identified an intricate WNT signaling network between fibroblast-like cells and epithelial and endothelial cells in adenomyosis (Fig. E ).Differentially expressed gene analysis in fibroblast-like cells from different tissues showed significant differences in expression of SFRP family members, which modulate WNT signaling (Figs. A, B ).The SFRPs antagonize WNT signaling by competing with WNT proteins for receptor binding () .We found that SFRPs are upregulated in fibroblast-like cells of adenomyosis compared with endometrium and normal-appearing myometrium, and that fibroblast-like cells in adenomyotic tissue express significantly higher SFRP and SFRP.Moreover, the WNT pathway is regulated at another level with increased signaling from fibroblast-like cells to epithelial cells (Figs. E, F ).This is suggestive that WNT activity may be upregulated in epithelial cells and downregulated via SFRPs in fibroblasts in adenomyotic tissue. Another recent study compared endometrial and myometrial tissues of women with or without diffuse adenomyosis at the transcriptomic level () .These investigators found that biological processes, including inflammation, extracellular matrix organization, collagen degradation, hyaluronan synthesis, and cell migration, were upregulated in adenomyosis.In the myometrial compartment, top biological processes in women with adenomyosis were extracellular matrix dysfunction, abnormal sensory pain perception, and g-aminobutyric acid synaptic transmission () .We also identified a unique cluster in adenomyosis (A) that has a strong signature for extracellular matrix-related genes (Fig. E ). There are some limitations to our study.Despite being a powerful approach to establishing the transcriptomic profile of individual cells in heterogenous cell populations, singlecell sequencing has drawbacks () .Single-cell sequencing technology allows assessment of heterogeneity in complex tissues, but low coverage prevents detection of mutations () .Thus, a major limitation of our study is a lack of mutation information.Additionally, we did not identify cell surface markers and, thus, could not sort cells to verify the identities or functions of the cell clusters.Because adenomyosis is a disease that develops within the myometrium, we originally expected to see a higher number of SMCs but found a higher complement of fibroblasts compared with SMCs.A potential explanation is that fibroblast-like cells were more easily digested than SMCs, and thus a higher number of fibroblast-like cells than SMCs were prepared and analyzed.Our findings, on the other hand, also may reflect the in vivo nature of myometrial tissue.In fact, a recent scRNA-seq analysis of the myometrium identified fibroblasts as a major component of this tissue () .Nevertheless, the comparative transcriptomic analysis of matched endometrium, adjacent myometrium, and adenomyotic tissue within the same uteri obtained from patients via scRNA-seq is a significant strength of our study.The only other study using scRNA-seq to evaluate adenomyosis used a single patient and did not provide any comparative information regarding normal-appearing myometrium of the adenomyotic uterus () . In conclusion, adenomyosis is a complex pathology associated with elaborate molecular mechanisms characterized by estrogen-dependent chronic inflammation, progesterone resistance, and epithelial KRAS mutations () .Recent DNA-based evidence provided irrefutable support that adenomyotic lesions originate from adjacent endometrial tissue; thus, the theory of entrapped endometrium as the origin of adenomyosis pertains () .Here, we used a cutting-edge procedure to define gene expression profiles of the individual cell types in adenomyotic tissue and adjacent endometrium and myometrium in an attempt to ascertain the cell-cell interactions and the key signaling pathways involved in the pathophysiology of adenomyosis.The WNT pathway turned out to be a candidate regulator of the critical biological processes in adenomyosis.We anticipate that our findings may facilitate the identification of new therapeutic targets for adenomyosis. Fertility and Sterility\\u00ae\",\n          \"Bladder dysfunction is a common complication following radical hysterectomy, caused by the damage to pelvic autonomic nerves that innervate the muscles of the bladder, urethral sphincter, and pelvic floor fasciae.Bladder dysfunction increases the rates of urinary tract infection, hospital visits or admission, and patient dissatisfaction.In addition, bladder dysfunction can also negatively impact patient quality of life (QoL).Several postoperative interventions have been proposed to prevent bladder dysfunction following radical hysterectomy.To our knowledge, there has been no systematic review evaluating the e ectiveness and safety of these interventions for preventing bladder dysfunction following radical hysterectomy in women with cervical cancer. To evaluate the e ectiveness and safety of postoperative interventions for preventing bladder dysfunction following radical hysterectomy in women with early-stage cervical cancer (stage IA to IIA). We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; , Issue ) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE via Ovid ( to April week , ), and Embase via Ovid ( Ovid ( to , week , week ).We also checked registers of clinical trials, grey literature, conference reports, and citation lists of included studies. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the e ectiveness and safety of any type of postoperative interventions for preventing bladder dysfunction following a radical hysterectomy in women with stage IA to IIA cervical cancer. Two review authors independently selected potentially relevant RCTs, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, compared results, and made judgments on the quality and certainty of the evidence.We resolved any disagreements through discussion or consultation with a third review author.Outcomes of interest consisted of spontaneous voiding recovery one week a er the operation, quality of life (QoL), adverse events, post-void residual urine volume one month a er the operation, urinary tract infection over the one month following the operation, and subjective urinary symptoms. None of the included studies reported rate of spontaneous voiding recovery one week a er surgery, time to a post-void residual volume of urine of mL or less, or post-void residual urine volume at and months a er surgery, all of which are important outcomes for assessing postoperative bladder dysfunction. Limited evidence suggested that bethanechol may minimise the risk of bladder dysfunction a er radical hysterectomy by lowering postvoid residual urine volume.The certainty of this evidence, however, was very low.The e ectiveness of di erent types of postoperative urinary catheterisation (suprapubic and intermittent self-catheterisation) remain unproven. The issue Radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy (removal of the uterus (womb) with its surrounding tissues and lymph glands in the pelvis) is the treatment for early-stage cervical cancer (when cancer is still within the cervix and upper vagina, without spread into nearby tissues).Bladder dysfunction (problems with the way the bladder holds and releases urine) is a common problem following radical hysterectomy, caused by the damage to the nerves controlling urination. To assess the usefulness and safety of treatment to prevent bladder dysfunction following radical hysterectomy in women with early-stage cervical cancer.We searched the scientific databases for randomised controlled trials (studies in which people or groups of people are allocated by chance to two or more groups, treating them di erently) published to April . We found four studies that met the inclusion criteria.One study compared a medication called bethanechol to placebo (a substance that has no therapeutic e ect, used as a control in testing drugs).Three studies compared suprapubic catheterisation (insertion of a flexible tube (catheter) into the bladder through a cut in the lower abdomen to drain urine) with intermittent self-catheterisation (insertion of a catheter via the urethra, into the bladder at intervals throughout the day). Bethanecol may reduce the chance of bladder dysfunction by lowering the volume of post-void residual urine, assessed at one month a er surgery.However, the certainty of this evidence is very low and further studies have the potential to better inform this outcome.*The risk in the intervention group (and its % confidence interval) is based on the assumed risk in the comparison group and the relative effect of the intervention (and its % CI).CI: confidence interval; MD: mean difference; RR: risk ratio GRADE Working Group grades of evidence High certainty: we are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect Moderate certainty: we are moderately confident in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different Low certainty: our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect Very low certainty: we have very little confidence in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect a The evidence was downgraded by two levels due to serious imprecision (small sample size and wide CI crossing the line of no e ect). b The evidence was downgraded by one level due to indirectness (reporting adverse events of unclear severity and unclear their association with the intervention).c The evidence was downgraded by one level due to unclear risk of selection bias.

Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer a ecting women worldwide, with an estimated , new cases and , cervical cancer-related deaths globally in (Bray ) .Cervical cancer is a major health problem among women in developing countries, with almost % of the global burden and % of cervical cancer-related deaths occurring in these regions (Ferlay ; Bray ) .The high burden of cervical cancer among less economically developed settings is secondary to the failure to provide e ective, large-scale screening programmes (Torre ; Bray ). Treatment of cervical cancer depends on the extent of the disease.Appendix displays a International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging system for cervical cancer (Bhatla ) , which was revised from the FIGO staging system (Appendix ).Women with early-stage cervical cancer (FIGO stage IA to IIA) can be treated with either radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy (removal of the uterus with its surrounding tissues and lymph glands in the pelvis) or pelvic chemoradiation (radiation therapy to lower abdomen being given at the same time as chemotherapy) (Landoni ) .In premenopausal women, radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy may be preferable to pelvic radiation in order to preserve ovarian function and vaginal elasticity, as well as prevent the long-term risks of pelvic radiation (Cull ; Viswanathan ) . The aim of radical hysterectomy is to remove the primary tumour with an adequate margin of normal tissue to ensure complete resection (Piver ; Querleu ; Verleye ) .Appendix lists details of the three systems for the classification of radical hysterectomy (Piver-Rutledge-Smith, Gynecological Cancer Group of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer, and Querleu and Morrow).The stage of cervical cancer is the fundamental factor to be taken into consideration when considering radical hysterectomy.Women with early-stage cervical cancer are traditionally treated with Piver type III radical hysterectomy.However, a previous randomised controlled trial (RCT) demonstrated that women with early-stage cervical cancer who underwent Piver type II hysterectomy (also called modified radical hysterectomy) had comparable oncological outcomes to those who underwent type III hysterectomy (Landoni ) .Pelvic lymphadenectomy is performed to look for metastatic lesions in the pelvic lymph nodes.The survival of women with earlystage cervical cancer who undergo radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy is excellent.Estimated five-year survival rates range between % and % (Kim ; Suprasert ; Srisomboon ; Mahawerawat ) . One of the most distressing morbidities that can occur following radical hysterectomy is bladder dysfunction (problems with the way the bladder holds and releases urine) (Lin ; Plotti ; Laterza ) .The incidence of bladder dysfunction a er radical hysterectomy varies from % to % depending on the method used in evaluating bladder dysfunction and the duration of follow-up (Zullo ; Wit ) .In addition, the risk of bladder dysfunction depends on the extent of surgery.Women undergoing type II radical hysterectomy are at lower risk of postoperative bladder dysfunction than those who undergo type III radical hysterectomy (Landoni ; Raspagliesi ) .By magnifying anatomical structures in the pelvis, laparoscopic approaches may help reduce the denervation of pelvic nerves during radical hysterectomy.However, it has yet to be shown that these approaches have a significant e ect on the prevention of bladder dysfunction (Laterza ; Kietpeerakool ) .Minimally invasive radical hysterectomy, however, is associated with inferior survival to laparotomy radical hysterectomy in women with earlystage cervical cancer.Consequently, a minimally invasive radical hysterectomy is not recommended.Although there may be a selective group of women for whom minimally invasive radical hysterectomy remains safe, further studies are needed (Ramirez ; Cusimano ; Chen ). Causes of bladder dysfunction following radical hysterectomy are secondary to the damage of pelvic autonomic nerves that innervate the muscles of the bladder (detrusor muscle), urethral sphincter and pelvic floor fasciae (Zullo ; Sellers ) .Bladder dysfunction following radical hysterectomy includes various functional disorders of the lower urinary tract, such as urinary retention, voiding di iculty, urinary hesitancy, urinary tract infection, and urinary stress incontinence (Chen ) . Bladder dysfunction increases the rates of urinary tract infection, hospital visits or admission, patient dissatisfaction, and the need for intermittent self-catheterisation (Manchana ) .Bladder dysfunction can also negatively impact patient quality of life (QoL), which can lead to embarrassment or even social isolation (Zhou ). Previous studies have demonstrated that a malfunctioning bladder detrusor muscle is a major cause of bladder dysfunction following radical hysterectomy (Plotti ; Laterza ) .Contraction of the detrusor muscle of the urinary bladder is stimulated by parasympathetic nerve impulses mediated by the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (Sellers ).Pharmacological therapy for voiding disorders consists of drugs that improve detrusor muscle contraction and those that reduce urethral resistance, which may have a role in the prevention of postoperative bladder dysfunction. Bethanechol, a cholinergic agent, is a synthetic ester, and is structurally and pharmacologically related to acetylcholine.Bethanechol increases the tone of the detrusor muscle by Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews stimulating the parasympathetic nervous system (Kemp ; Madeiro ) . Cisapride is a prokinetic agent.It is principally prescribed for treating gastro-oesophageal reflux in children.The mechanism of action of cisapride is to stimulate the release of acetylcholine, thus promoting detrusor muscle contractility.Hence, as a result of its parasympathomimetic e ect, cisapride may be e ective for treating bladder hypotonia a er surgery (Madeiro ) .Cisapride, however, has been restricted to a limited access programme in the USA and Europe because it is associated with serious side e ects, including cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heart rhythms) and death (Henney ) . Suprapubic catheterisation (SPC), an insertion of a catheter via postoperative suprapubic cystostomy, has been proposed to hasten the recovery of bladder function compared with an indwelling urethral catheter, by minimising the risks of a urinary tract infection and asymptomatic bacteriuria, which can impede bladder function activity returning to normal (Kidd ) . Bladder training is an important form of behaviour therapy that can be e ective in treating bladder dysfunction following radical hysterectomy (Goldfarb ) To evaluate the e ectiveness and safety of postoperative interventions for preventing bladder dysfunction following radical hysterectomy in women with early-stage cervical cancer (FIGO stage IA to IIA). Criteria for considering studies for this review We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Women We planned to include any trial that attempted to compare the following. \\u2022 A pharmacological agent and placebo or standard care. \\u2022 Rate of spontaneous voiding recovery at one week a er surgery.We defined spontaneous voiding recovery as a voluntary void that has mL or less of urine remaining in the bladder, measured by clean intermittent catheterisation a er the woman feels as though her bladder is empty.\\u2022 Quality of life (QoL), determined using a scale that has been validated in accordance with the norms reported in a peer-reviewed publication (i.e. the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-CX cervical cancer-specific QoL questionnaire (Greimel ) ). \\u2022 Time a er surgery to a post-void residual urine volume of mL or less (days).Post-void residual urine was defined as the amount of urine retained in the bladder a er a voluntary void, measured by clean intermittent catheterisation a er the participant feels as though bladder is empty.We planned to present a 'Summary of findings' table reporting the following outcomes listed in order of priority. \\u2022 Rate of spontaneous voiding recovery at one week a er surgery. \\u2022 QoL. \\u2022 Time a er surgery to a post-void residual urine volume of mL or less (days).\\u2022 Adverse events. \\u2022 Post-void residual urine volume one month a er surgery. \\u2022 Urinary tract infections in the first month a er surgery. \\u2022 Subjective urinary symptoms. We included only randomised controlled trials (RCTs), irrespective of the language of publication, publication status or sample size. We searched the following electronic databases on April . We searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (who.int/ictrp/en/) and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify any ongoing trials.If we identified ongoing trials that had not been published, we planned to approach the principal investigators and major co-operative groups active in this area to ask for relevant data.We searched the following databases for grey literature: Open-Grey (opengrey.eu/)and Index to theses (proquest.com/products-services/pqdt_uk_ireland.html). We handsearched reports of conferences from the following sources. \\u2022 Annual Meeting of the Society of Gynecologic Oncology. \\u2022 Annual Meeting of the International Gynecologic Cancer Society. \\u2022 Annual Meeting of the European Society of Medical Oncology. \\u2022 Annual Meeting of the British Gynaecological Cancer Society. \\u2022 Biennial Meeting of the Asian Society of Gynecologic Oncology. \\u2022 Biennial Meeting of Asia and Oceania Federation of Obstetrics and Gynaecology. Oncology. We checked the citation lists of the included studies and key textbooks for potentially relevant references.We searched for papers in all languages and translated them, if necessary.We planned to include unpublished trials only if trial data and methodological descriptions were provided in written form or through direct contact with the trial authors. We downloaded all titles and abstracts retrieved via an electronic search of the Endnote reference management database.A er duplicates were removed, we transferred these data to Covidence (covidence.org).Two review authors (AA and CK) examined the remaining references independently.We excluded those studies which clearly did not meet the inclusion criteria, and we obtained full-text copies of potentially relevant references.Two review authors (AA and CK) independently assessed the eligibility of the retrieved reports or publications.We resolved any disagreement through discussion or, if required, we planned to consult a third review author (KG or PL).We identified and excluded duplicates and collated multiple reports of the same study so that each study, rather than each report, is the unit of interest in the review.We used the details obtained from the selection process in Covidence to complete a PRISMA flow diagram and 'Characteristics of excluded studies' table (Liberati ) . Copyright \\u00a9 The Cochrane Collaboration.Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Two review authors (AA and CK) independently extracted study characteristics and outcome data from included studies using Covidence.We noted in the 'Characteristics of included studies' table if outcome data were not reported in a usable way.We resolved disagreements by consensus or by involving a third review author (KG or TT).One review author (CK) checked study characteristics for accuracy against the trial report. For included studies, we extracted the following data. \\u2022 Author, year of publication, and journal citation (including language).\\u2022 Country. \\u2022 Setting. \\u2022 Inclusion and exclusion criteria. \\u2022 Study methodology. \\u2022 Study population and disease characteristics: \\u2022 total number enrolled; \\u2022 participant characteristics; \\u2022 age; \\u2022 co-morbidities; \\u2022 other baseline characteristics; \\u2022 percentage of participants with non-cervical cancer (only RCTs involving mixed gynaecologic malignancies); \\u2022 FIGO stage of cervical cancer; \\u2022 the histopathological subtype of cervical cancer; \\u2022 tumour size (largest tumour diameter); \\u2022 the radicality of surgery (Piver or Querleu-Morrow). \\u2022 Intervention details: \\u2022 schedule of bladder training; \\u2022 suprapubic cystostomy technique; \\u2022 acupuncture; \\u2022 cholinergic agents (dose, duration). \\u2022 placebo; \\u2022 no intervention.\\u2022 Risk of bias in the study (see below). \\u2022 Duration of follow-up. \\u2022 Outcomes: for each outcome, we extracted the outcome definition and unit of measurement (if relevant); for adjusted estimates, we recorded variables adjusted for in analyses. \\u2022 Results: we extracted the number of participants allocated to each intervention group, the total number analysed for each outcome, and the missing participants.\\u2022 Notes: funding for trial and notable conflicts of interest of trial authors. We assessed and reported on the methodological quality and risk of bias in included studies in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins ) , which recommends the explicit reporting of the following individual elements for RCTs. \\u2022 Selection bias: random sequence generation and allocation concealment. \\u2022 Performance bias: blinding of participants and personnel (treatment providers).\\u2022 Detection bias: blinding of outcome assessment. \\u2022 Attrition bias: incomplete outcome data. \\u2022 Reporting bias: selective reporting of outcomes. \\u2022 Other possible bias. We considered outcome data as complete if at least % of participants underwent follow-ups and were assessed for primary outcomes.Two review authors (AA and CK) independently applied the 'Risk of bias' tool and resolved di erences by discussion or by appeal to a third review author (KG or PL).We judged each item as being at high, low or unclear risk of bias as set out in the criteria displayed in Appendix . We provided a quote from the study report or a statement, or both, as justification for our judgement for each item in the 'Risk of bias' table.We summarised results in both a 'Risk of bias' graph and a 'Risk of bias' summary.When interpreting treatment e ects and meta-analyses, we took into account the risk of bias in the studies that contribute to that outcome.Where information on risk of bias relates to unpublished data or correspondence with trial authors, we planned to note this in the table. We used the following measures of the e ect of treatment. \\u2022 For dichotomous outcomes (e.g.rate of spontaneous voiding recovery one week a er surgery, rate of urethral catheter removal, rate of urinary tract infections, number of participants with normal detrusor pressure at maximum flow, adverse events), we analysed data based on the number of events and the number of women assessed in the intervention and comparison groups.We used these to calculate the risk ratio and % confidence interval.\\u2022 For continuous outcomes (e.g.duration of postoperative retained urethral catheterisation, post-void residual urine volume and QoL measures), we analysed data based on the means, standard deviations and number of women assessed for both the intervention and comparison groups to calculate the mean di erences between treatment arms with their % confidence intervals.If the mean di erence was reported without individual group data, we used this to report the study results.If more than one study measured the same outcome using di erent tools, we calculated the standardised mean di erence and % confidence interval using the inverse variance method.\\u2022 For time-to-event data (e.g.time a er surgery to a post-void residual urine volume of mL or less), we planned to extract the log of the hazard ratio (log HR ) and its standard error from trial reports.If these were not reported, we planned to estimate the log HR and its standard error using the methods of Parmar . We included studies in which individual women were randomised. In a study with multiple intervention groups, we planned to combine all relevant experimental intervention groups into a single group to create a single pair-wise comparison, where possible (Higgins ) . Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. We planned to contact the original investigators to request missing data.If we could not contact the investigators or could not obtain the requested missing data, we planned to analyse only the available data and not to impute missing outcome data for any of the outcomes. We clinically assessed heterogeneity by visual inspection of forest plots.We assessed statistical heterogeneity in each meta-analysis using the I statistic and Chi test (Higgins ) .We regarded heterogeneity as substantial if the I statistic value was greater than % or there was a low P value (< .) in the Chi test for heterogeneity (Deeks ; Higgins ) .If there was substantial statistical heterogeneity, we planned to carry out subgroup analyses to assess di erences among the included studies.However, if there was both clinical and methodological heterogeneity across included studies, we planned to not report pooled results from meta-analysis, but instead use a narrative approach to data synthesis. See Di erences between protocol and review. We were unable to assess reporting bias, as only four studies met our inclusion criteria. We applied the random-e ects model with inverse variance weighting for all meta-analyses (DeSimonian ).We performed statistical analysis using Review Manager . (Review Manager ). \\u2022 For time-to-event data, we planned to pool hazard ratios using the generic inverse variance.\\u2022 For any dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the risk ratios for each study and then pooled them.\\u2022 For continuous outcomes, we pooled the mean di erences among the treatment arms, if all trials measure the outcome on the same scale; otherwise we planned to pool standardised mean di erences See Di erences between protocol and review. We intended to carry out subgroup analyses in order to assess the e ect of the following factors. \\u2022 Tumour size ( cm or less versus more than cm). \\u2022 Surgical approach (laparotomy versus minimally invasive surgery).\\u2022 Nerve-sparing approach during a radical hysterectomy (yes versus no).We planned to assess subgroup di erences using the interaction tests available within Review Manager .We planned to report the results of subgroup analyses by quoting the Chi statistic and P value, the interaction test, and the I statistic.However, we did not perform subgroup analysis, as most analyses were based on only one or two included studies.Nevertheless, we acknowledged these factors in the interpretation of review findings. See Di erences between protocol and review. We were unable to conduct any of the planned sensitivity analyses due to insu icient data.If more studies are included in a future update, we plan to perform sensitivity analyses in order to assess the e ect of the following factors. \\u2022 Repeating the analysis excluding unpublished studies (if any). \\u2022 Repeating the analysis excluding studies judged to be at 'high' or 'unclear' risk of bias for allocation concealment. We created Summary of findings tables to summarise the results of the meta-analyses conducted for each of the outcomes, as outlined in the section Types of outcome measures.We graded the overall certainty of the evidence for each outcome according to the GRADE approach, which takes into account issues related not only to internal validity (risk of bias, inconsistency, imprecision, publication bias) but also to external validity, such as directness of results (Langendam ) .We created a 'Summary of findings' table based on the methods described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Sch\\u00fcnemann ), and used GRADEpro GDT (Summary of findings ; Summary of findings ). \\u2022 High certainty: the true e ect lies close to that of the estimate of the e ect.\\u2022 Moderate certainty: the true e ect is likely to be close to the estimate of the e ect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially di erent.\\u2022 Low certainty: the true e ect may be substantially di erent from the estimate of the e ect.\\u2022 Very low certainty: the true e ect is likely to be substantially di erent from the estimate of e ect. We downgraded the evidence from 'high' certainty by one level for each serious (or by two for each very serious) limitation. ) .Suprapubic catheterisation consisted of insertion of a Bonanno suprapubic catheter at the time of surgery, followed by free drainage, followed by catheter removal at five to seven days a er the surgery. None of the included studies reported rate of spontaneous voiding recovery at one week a er surgery, time to a post-void residual urine volume of mL or less, post-void residual urine volume at and months a er surgery, and poor bladder compliance. Nwabineli reported time a er surgery to a post-void residual urine volume of less than mL, adverse events, and rate of urinary tract infections in the first month a er surgery. Suprasert reported time a er surgery to a post-void residual urine volume of less than mL, adverse events, and rate of urinary tract infections in the first month a er surgery. Naik reported QoL, time a er surgery to a post-void residual urine volume of less than mL, adverse events, rate of urinary tract infections in the first month a er surgery, and subjective urinary symptoms. Madeiro reported post-void residual urine volume one month a er surgery, flow rate, maximum flow rate, number of women with low maximum flow rate, number of women with low detrusor pressure at maximum flow, and bladder compliance. See Characteristics of excluded studies, Characteristics of ongoing studies, and Characteristics of studies awaiting classification. We excluded seven reports because their participants were not the population that this review aimed to assess See Characteristics of included studies table, Figure , and Figure for full details.Madeiro stated that the participants were allocated using a computerised randomisation schedule.However, they did not state the concealment process.This trial therefore was at unclear risk of selection bias. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Naik stated that the participants were randomised by drawing a sealed envelope that developed from an independent administrator, but did not state the methods of random sequence generation.Consequently, this trial was judged as having an unclear risk of selection bias. Nwabineli stated that the participants were randomised using random sampling numbers.However, they did not state the allocation concealment process.This trial therefore was at unclear risk of selection bias. Madeiro stated that all medications were provided in packages of identical appearance.Identification was only made by a standardised code.Randomisation was only revealed at the end of the trial and was controlled by an independent investigator.This trial, therefore, was at low risk of performance and detection biases. Blinding of participants and personnel was not feasible in Nwabineli , Suprasert , and Naik , which compared suprapubic catheterisation versus intermittent selfcatheterisation.However, the outcomes of interest (i.e.time a er surgery to a post-void residual urine volume less than mL, adverse events, and rate of urinary tract infections in the first month a er surgery) were unlikely to be a ected by lack of blinding of participants and personnel.Hence, we considered these studies as having a low risk of bias for this domain. All included studies were at low risk of attrition bias as they had low percentages of withdrawals and dropouts (Nwabineli ; Suprasert ; Naik ; Madeiro ).See Characteristics of included studies for the proportion of participants analysed. None of the included studies reported the rate of spontaneous voiding recovery one week a er surgery, or post-void residual urine volume at and months a er surgery.Quality of life (QoL), adverse events and subjective urinary symptoms, which are important outcomes, were rarely reported.An adverse event was assessed only in Suprasert .Naik reported QoL and subjective urinary symptoms but available data, however, were insu icient to calculate the relative measures of the e ect of interventions.Due to a lack of reported outcomes that are the elements necessary for decision-making, all included studies thus were at high risk of reporting bias (Higgins ) . There was no Information indicating other important risks of bias.Accordingly, all included studies were judged as having a low risk of bias for this domain. See: Summary of findings Bethanechol compared to placebo for preventing bladder dysfunction a er radical hysterectomy in women with early-stage cervical cancer; Summary of findings Suprapubic catheterisation compared to intermittent selfcatheterisation for preventing bladder dysfunction a er radical hysterectomy in women with early-stage cervical cancer None of the studies reported the rate of spontaneous voiding recovery one week a er surgery, time a er surgery to a postvoid residual urine volume of mL or less, post-void residual urine volume at and months a er surgery, and poor bladder compliance.Consequently, we added time a er surgery to a postvoid residual urine volume of mL or less, and mL or less, respectively, and bladder compliance, as additional secondary outcomes (see Di erences between protocol and review). Madeiro reported four-arm comparisons including placebo; bethanechol alone given mg orally every eight hours; cisapride alone given mg orally every eight hours; and a combination of mg of bethanechol and cisapride given orally every eight hours.As cisapride has been restricted in the USA and Europe due to its serious side e ects, including cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heart rhythms) and death, we, therefore, included only the data obtained from participants allocated to placebo and bethanechol alone in the analyses. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. No data were reported for this outcome. No data were reported for this outcome. Flow rate at one month a er surgery among participants receiving bethanechol was higher than that noted among participants allocated to placebo (MD ., % CI . to .; participants; Analysis .). The maximum flow rate at one month a er surgery among participants receiving bethanechol was higher compared to those who were assigned to the placebo group (MD ., % CI . to .; participants; Analysis .). Participants receiving bethanechol had a lower risk of having a low maximum flow rate than those given placebo (RR ., % . to .; participants; Analysis .). Detrusor pressure at maximum flow, assessed at one month a er surgery among participants receiving bethanechol was higher than that noted among participants receiving placebo (MD ., % CI . to .; participants; Analysis .). Participants receiving bethanechol had a lower risk of encountering low detrusor pressure at maximum flow than those given placebo (RR ., % CI . to .; participants; Analysis .). See Di erences between protocol and review. The trial did not report poor bladder compliance but reported bladder compliance assessed at one month a er surgery.There was no di erence in bladder compliance evaluated at one month following surgery between the two comparison groups (MD ., % CI -. to .; participants; Analysis .). Four reports of Nwabineli , Suprasert , and Naik compared SPC versus ISC. None of the studies reported the rate of spontaneous voiding recovery one week a er surgery. Naik and their update report assessed QoL among participants at weeks, weeks and weeks a er surgery, using EORTC QLQ C questionnaires.The trial found no significant di erences between the two groups.Nevertheless, data were insu icient for calculating MD of QoL scores among the comparison groups. None of the studies reported this outcome.See Di erences between protocol and review.Suprasert , assessing participants, found that women given SPC went a longer time to a post-void residual urine volume of mL or less than women given ISC (MD . days, % CI . to .; Analysis .). See Di erences between protocol and review. Nwabineli and Naik reported time a er surgery to a post-void residual urine volume of mL or less.A meta-analysis assessing women showed that women given SPC went a shorter time a er surgery to a post-void residual urine volume of mL or less than women given ISC (MD -. days, % CI -. to -.; two studies, very low certainty evidence; Analysis .).The percentage of variability in e ect estimates due to heterogeneity rather than to chance was not important (I = %). Suprasert , assessing participants, reported acute complications a er surgery.The trial showed no di erence in risk of acute complications a er surgery (RR ., % CI . to .; very low certainty evidence; Analysis .) between participants who underwent SPC (four events in participants) and those who underwent ISC (six events in participants). None of the studies reported this outcome. In Nwabineli , of participants assigned to the SPC group and of participants assigned to the ISC group experienced urinary tract infection.In Suprasert , of participants and of participants assigned to the SPC and ISC groups, respectively, experienced urinary tract infection. A meta-analysis of Nwabineli and Suprasert , assessing participants, showed no di erence in risk of the rate of urinary tract infections during the first month a er surgery (RR ., % CI . to .; very low certainty evidence; Analysis .).The percentage of variability in e ect estimates due to heterogeneity rather than to chance was not important (I = %). Naik and their update publication reported subjective urinary symptoms using a urinary symptoms questionnaire (USQ).This trial found no di erences in terms of subjective urinary symptoms between participants undergoing suprapubic catheterisation and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews those who underwent intermittent self-catheterisation. Available data, however, were insu icient to calculate the relative measures of the e ect of interventions.We were unable to obtain additional data by contacting the authors of the trial. None of the studies under this comparison reported this outcome. None of the studies under this comparison reported this outcome. None of the studies under this comparison reported this outcome. None of the studies under this comparison reported this outcome. None of the studies under this comparison reported this outcome. None of the studies under this comparison reported this outcome. The findings of this review were based on five reports of four included studies (see Figure ).One trial compared bethanechol versus placebo (Madeiro ) .Three studies compared SPC versus ISC (Nwabineli ; Suprasert ; Naik ) . \\u2022 No information on the rate of spontaneous voiding recovery at one week following operation was reported in any of the included studies.QoL, adverse events, and subjective urinary symptoms were rarely assessed in the current evidence. We identified five published reports from four RCTs that included two comparisons of the interventions given to prevent bladder dysfunction a er radical hysterectomy for cervical cancer including bethanechol versus placebo and SPC versus ISC.The primary outcomes of this review were the rate of spontaneous voiding recovery at one week a er surgery and QoL.However, none of the studies reported the rate of spontaneous voiding recovery one week a er surgery.In addition, only one trial assessed QoL, but data were insu icient for assessing the e ect of the intervention. Applicability of evidence is limited by the quantity and certainty of the review results.The lack of data regarding primary outcomes of interest in almost all included studies and the very low certainty of available evidence may impede the applicability of the review findings.It is thus di icult to make any adequate judgements regarding the e ectiveness of the interventions assessed in this review.Additionally, it is important to note that the surgical techniques applied in almost all of the participants were conventional laparotomy radical hysterectomy.Therefore, the results may not be fully applicable to other surgical techniques (i.e.laparoscopic radical hysterectomy or nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy). In the protocol, we planned to assess the certainty of evidence by eleven relevant outcomes including the rate of spontaneous voiding recovery at one week a er surgery, QoL, time a er surgery to a post-void residual urine volume of mL or less, adverse events, post-void residual urine volume at one month a er surgery, rate of urinary tract infection in the first month a er surgery, and subjective urinary symptoms (Aue-aungkul ). As the review included only four studies, we obtained evidence from few studies and small number of participants for each comparison.Using GRADE assessments, we graded the certainty of the evidence as follows. \\u2022 Bethanechol versus placebo: information on post-void residual urine volume assessed at one month a er surgery was downgraded to very low certainty evidence due to important imprecision (combination of sparse data and a low number of events) and unclear risk of selection bias.No information on the rate of spontaneous voiding recovery at one week following the operation, QoL, adverse events, urinary tract infection in the first month a er surgery, and subjective urinary symptoms were reported under this comparison (see Summary of findings ). With assistance from the Information Specialist of the Cochrane Gynaecological, Neuro-oncology and Orphan Cancers Group, we were able to conduct a comprehensive literature search, including a search of the grey literature, conference proceedings and abstracts, citation lists of included studies, and registered databases of ongoing studies.In addition, bias was minimised in terms of the overall review process by following the recommendations in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins ) . As this review included only four studies, there remains the possibility of publication bias.We did not perform a funnel plot, as the analyses were limited to only one or two studies.Because of the small number of included studies, we did not carry out sensitivity and subgroup analyses as planned in the review protocol (Aueaungkul ).None of the review authors have any links to drug companies or financial interest in the prescription of the drug under evaluation, nor did they participate in the conduct of any of the included trials.Therefore, there were no known conflicts of interest of the authors of this review.Kietpeerakool recently reported a Cochrane Review and metaanalysis assessing the e ectiveness and potential harms of nervesparing radical hysterectomy in women with early-stage cervical cancer.Nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy is a modified surgical technique developed to permit surgical removal (resection) of oncologically relevant tissues surrounding the cervical cancer lesion while preserving pelvic autonomic nerves.This review noted that the nerve-sparing technique may lessen the risk of postoperative bladder dysfunction compared to the conventional radical hysterectomy.Nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy reduced postoperative bladder dysfunctions in terms of a shorter time to post-void residual urine volume of mL or less (mean di erence (MD) -. days, % CI -. to -.; low certainty evidence) and lower volume of post-void residual urine measured one month following operation (MD -. days, % CI -. to -.; low certainty evidence). To date, our review is the first systematic review evaluating the e ectiveness and safety of various postoperative interventions for preventing bladder dysfunction a er radical hysterectomy for early-stage cervical cancer.Limited evidence suggested that bethanechol may minimise the risk of bladder dysfunction a er radical hysterectomy by means of lower post-void residual urine volume assessed one month a er surgery and better results of urodynamic assessment.The e ectiveness of di erent types of postoperative urinary catheterisation (suprapubic and intermittent self-catheterisation), however, remained unproven by available evidence obtained from RCTs.In a retrospective cohort study conducted among women with early-stage cervical cancer who underwent radical hysterectomy, postoperative SPC was associated with shorter time to trial of voiding and lower urinary tract infection compared to transurethral catheterisation (Wells ). There are no RCTs assessing the e ectiveness of bladder training for preventing bladder dysfunction following radical hysterectomy with a focus on women with early-stage cervical cancer.Three reports of two RCTs assessing bladder training following radical hysterectomy which included women with early-stage and locally advanced-stage cervical cancer failed to note the e ectiveness of this intervention (Santaguida ; Fanfani ; Gong ).One RCT reported in Santaguida and Fanfani found that the median duration of time a er surgery to a post-void residual urine volume of mL or less was four days in the bladder training group (range day to days) and three days in the control group (range day to days).Gong reported no di erence in the risk of urinary tract infections during the first month a er surgery between the women assigned to bladder training (.%) and women in the control group (.%).Based on these findings, the e ectiveness of bladder training for preventing bladder dysfunction following radical hysterectomy for cervical cancer, therefore, remained unconfirmed. In general, the studies included in this review are very small, and thus make inferences challenging in the face of very low certainty evidence.None of the included studies reported the primary outcomes and various important secondary outcomes that this review aimed to assess (i.e.rate of spontaneous voiding recovery one week a er surgery, time to a post-void residual urine volume of mL or less, and post-void residual urine volumes at and months a er surgery. Very low-certainty evidence obtained from one small RCT indicated that bethanechol may minimise the risk of bladder dysfunction a er radical hysterectomy by means of lower post-void residual urine volume assessed at one month a er surgery and better results of the urodynamic assessment.However, there was a lack of data regarding clinically important outcomes (i.e.rate of spontaneous voiding recovery, QoL, adverse events, urinary tract infection, and subjective urinary symptoms).There was insu icient evidence to indicate whether SPC lessens the risk of bladder dysfunction following radical hysterectomy. In light of the results of this review, bethanechol may be an option for the treatment of bladder dysfunction following radical hysterectomy.However, the benefits and harms of this cholinomimetic drug need to be reassessed in further adequately powered, high-quality RCTs.If this pharmacological intervention can be shown to prevent bladder dysfunction, additional information regarding optimal dose and duration of treatment are required. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. In addition, particular attention should be paid to an assessment of a combination therapy with bethanechol and an alpha-adrenergic blocker, which was shown to be more e ective than bethanechol alone in a previous RCT conducted among patients with various causes of underactive bladder (Yamanishi ; Kim ). Importantly, any further studies should encompass an evaluation of the rate of spontaneous voiding recovery, QoL, time to a postvoid residual urine volume of mL or less, post-void residual urine volume, adverse events, and urinary tract infections which are clinically important outcomes for clinical-decision making.Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews -Quality of life (EORTC QLQ C) questionnaire at weeks, weeks and weeks following surgery Notes -The ISC protocol consisted of insertion of a transurethral indwelling catheter at the time of surgery which remained on free drainage until day , at which time it was withdrawn and the patient commenced ISC.ISC was continued until satisfactory frequency/volumes and RUVs were achieved (minimum mL of urine, at least four hourly during the day, with residual urine volumes of < mL). -The SPC protocol consisted of insertion of a Bonanno suprapubic catheter at the time of surgery followed by free drainage until day at which time it was clamped.Patients were then requested to pass urine at least every hours during the day following which the RUV was measured by releasing the clamp.SPC was continued until satisfactory frequency/volumes and RUVs as described above were achieved. During the operation, all patients had an indwelling free draining Foley's catheter. At the end of the operation, a Becton-Dickenson Bonanno catheter was inserted if randomisation had indicated a suprapubic catheter and the urethral catheter was removed.In those patients randomised to receive urethral catheters, this was le in situ. Trial of voiding started on the fi h postoperative day.Catheters were removed when the residual urine was \\u2264 mL.Antibiotics were not administered routinely in the postoperative period.Daily catheter specimens of urine were examined bacteriologically daily until the catheters were removed except in patients who went home with their catheters in situ. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Study duration: September to June Participants stage IB-IIA cervical cancer patients who underwent radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy (RHPL).At the end of the RHPL operation, the participants were allocated immediately into the intermittent self-catheterisation (N=) or the suprapubic catheterisation (N=) group before abdominal closure.

Treatment modalities that help men with infertility achieve their goal of having a healthy child have undergone multiple stepwise advancements over the years-from assisted reproductive technology and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) to the use of microscopic sperm extraction techniques to diagnostic technologies such as whole-genome sequencing and sperm function testing () .Advancements such as microscopic sperm extraction have allowed physicians to be more efficient in collecting seminiferous tubules that are more likely to contain sperms (); however, laboratory tissue processing after microscopic collection remains a challenge because the process is currently performed manually; can require - hours of careful examination; and is dependent on the examiner's level of expertise, fatigue, and ability to visualize sperms () .The automation of this tedious process could facilitate greater efficiency of andrology laboratory personnel and supplement their initial searches, which could be especially helpful in cases of nonobstructive azoospermia (NOA).Lee et al. ( ) demonstrated this automation in their study; the investigators used a machine learning algorithm to detect rare sperm in microscopic testicular sperm extraction samples from men with NOA using bright-field microscopy.The investigators trained their convolutional neural network using bright-field images paired with fluorescenttagged sperm images to establish the ground truth before algorithm validation.Overall, the algorithm had .% sensitivity, with a % positive predictive value.Lee et al. ( ) demonstrated the ingenious use of machine learning technology to provide an additional tool for laboratory personnel while searching for sperms in men with NOA. Automation to identify sperms in the andrology laboratory could allow more efficient and more effective identification of rare sperms, which would be a substantial advancement in the field of male infertility.However, although sperm identification remains crucial, there are currently no nondestructive technologies or processes that allow the evaluation of the quality of the sperm after it is retrieved.The next breakthrough in sperm collection and processing will be the identification of the most viable sperm for use in ICSI or sperm selection.Embryo selection has undergone significant advancements over the years; the current modalities of embryo assessment rely either on embryo growth over a period of days and subsequent grading based on subjective morphology or destructive testing of nonessential cells in the trophectoderm (preimplantation genetic testing); neither of these options can be applied to sperm selection.As such, novel modalities for sperm selection will need to be developed; the most promising approach may be through nondestructive imaging techniques.Technologies such as Raman spectroscopy and quantitative phase imaging provide the ability to assess cellular contents, including aneuploidy, methylation, and DNA packaging, all of which could help identify sperms that can lead to the most optimal embryonic development () .As technologies such as machine learning to automate rare sperm identification become more widespread and potentially allow for the identification of a few rare sperms in men who previously had no sperms identified, the subsequent selection of the most optimal sperm for use in ICSI will become more and more essential.We believe that continued, stepwise advancements and wide implementation of these technologies will further help couples with infertility achieve their goal of a healthy child.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"summary\",\n

In its advanced stages, the disease imitates malignancy, not in terms of histology but by its clinical course.The unclear etiology and lack of effective medical therapy make adenomyosis a challenging clinical disorder.It is clear, however, that estrogen is essential for the growth of ectopic endometrium outside the uterus (, ) .Therefore, medical strategies blocking ovarian steroidogenesis and local estrogen synthesis by the aromatase enzyme represent an indispensable option for treatment () .However, the majority of patients require hysterectomy (, ) , which is a radical treatment but not an appropriate option for women who desire pregnancy. Adenomyosis once was seen as a disease of parous women that could be diagnosed only by surgical resection and pathological examination () .However, advancements in high-resolution imaging now allow for noninvasive diagnosis by magnetic resonance imaging or transvaginal ultrasound (, ) .Ultrasound features of the adenomyotic uterus include an enlarged uterus, asymmetry of the myometrial thickness, a poorly defined endomyometrial junction, and heterogeneously hypoechoic myometrium () .Development of noninvasive diagnostic techniques also revealed a higher prevalence of adenomyosis in infertile women (, ) ; suggested mechanisms underlying uterine factor infertility include abnormal decidualization resulting in impaired endometrial receptivity, altered peristalsis of the uterus, and disruption of the endomyometrial junction (, ) .Alterations in the immune system linked to sex steroid hormone changes and epithelial mesenchymal transition in women with adenomyosis may promote inflammation and impair fertility () .Some studies have shown that adenomyosis is associated not only with infertility but also increased risk of miscarriage (, ) . Recent research has led to new insights into the molecular pathophysiology of adenomyosis.Evidence from nextgeneration screening-based studies identified KRAS mutations in endometrial epithelial cell clones and adjacent adenomyotic tissue (, ) .These activating KRAS mutations, which also have been found in endometriosis, are one of the most frequent driver mutations in malignancies, such as lung, pancreatic, and colorectal cancers () .KRAS mutations in adenomyosis and endometriosis are confined to endometrial epithelial cells and associated with specific pathways that increase cell survival and proliferation () .These mutations also have been associated with progesterone resistance in adenomyosis () .The findings of next-generation screening-based studies favor mechanisms involving invagination of mutated cells rather than metaplasia or differentiation of progenitor cells; however, more work is needed to understand gene expression in the extremely heterogeneous adenomyotic cell populations and cross talk with surrounding tissues. The histologically complex nature of adenomyosis, with island-like structures inside the myometrium that also contain endometrial and myometrial cells, makes it difficult to identify pathophysiologic mechanisms based on the average gene expression of the whole tissue because of the background noise or dilution issues.Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has opened a new era in research that enables investigators to reveal the heterogeneity in complex tissues and understand how distinct cell types contribute to disease () .In a recent study, scRNA-seq of endometrial tissues collected throughout the menstrual cycle from healthy women revealed cell types based on the transcriptomic profile of epithelial cells and stromal fibroblasts during major phases of endometrial transformation () .Here, we applied scRNA-seq to analyze the cellular composition and transcriptomic profiles of matched tissues of endometrium, normal myometrium, and adenomyosis from the same hysterectomy specimens collected from women, with the goal of identifying specific signaling pathways and cell-cell interactions in the adenomyotic uterus that contribute to this complex disease. Northwestern University's institutional review board approved the use of human tissue for this study.After obtaining written informed consent, adenomyotic tissue and adjacent normal endometrium and normal myometrium were obtained from premenopausal women undergoing hysterectomy for adenomyosis.Three samples were collected from each patient, for a total of samples from patients.Briefly, after hysterectomy, samples from each hysterectomy specimen were dissected by a senior pathologist immediately and confirmed histologically using hematoxylin and eosin staining.Normal-appearing endometrial and myometrial samples were obtained at cm from adenomyotic tissue.For normalappearing endometrium we obtained a full thickness section of endometrial tissue that included functionalis and basalis layers.After tissue dissection and digestion as described below, single-cell suspensions were submitted for scRNAseq in the Northwestern University NUSeq Core (Fig. A ).The age range of the patients was - years and each patient had at least previous delivery.No patient had been receiving hormonal treatment at the time of tissue collection for a period of at least months preoperatively.All tissues were collected during the follicular phase.The cycle phase was determined based on last menstrual period and histology.All patients had diagnoses of diffuse adenomyosis confirmed by pathology reports. Adenomyotic, endometrial, and myometrial tissues were dissociated and cells were isolated using a previously described protocol () .Briefly, tissues were digested or frozen within hours after hysterectomy.Samples from patients ( samples) were processed fresh.The remaining patient's samples ( samples) were frozen due to lack of available appointments in the Northwestern University NUSeq Core.For the fresh samples, tissues were kept in HypoThermosol FRS Solution (BioLife Solutions, Bothell, WA) for up to hours.Tissues were minced into very small pieces in a petri dish with Hank's balanced salt solution, then placed in a mL Falcon tube with digestion enzyme mixture (collagenase, protease, DNase, hyaluronidase, and calcium chloride) in mL Hank's balanced salt solution.Tissues were incubated for hours in a C bead bad incubator with minutes of gentle shaking every minutes.After enzymatic and mechanical digestion, the tissue fraction was allowed to sediment out (approximately - minutes).The stromal cells and smooth muscle cells were collected by passing the digested supernatant through -mm cell sieves and debris was left in the filter.Red blood cell lysis was performed for the stromal cell fraction.For adenomyotic and endometrial tissues, the epithelial cell pellets were backwashed by inverting the cell strainer and centrifugation.The supernatant was removed, and epithelial cells were digested further with mL TrypLE express enzyme (Gibco, Billings, MNT) at C for minutes, followed by passing through -mm cell sieves to obtain single epithelial cell suspensions.Epithelial and stroma cell suspensions were centrifuged at relative centrifugal force for minutes at room temperature.After removing the supernatant without disrupting the pellet, stromal and epithelial cells were suspended and mixed together in \\u00c2 phosphate-buffered saline with .% bovine serum albumin ( mg/mL) to achieve the target cell concentration (< million cells per tube in mL washing solution in mL DNA LoBind Tubes).Epithelial cell digestion steps were skipped for normal myometrium tissue because significant numbers of epithelial cells were expected in the sample.For all tissue types, to remove the remaining cell debris and large clumps, the cell suspension was pipetted gently and filtered with Scienceware mm Flowm Tip strainers (VWR, Radnor, PA).For frozen samples, the tissue was minced into very small pieces immediately after collection from the pathology core and split into cryovials containing Cryostor CS Freeze media (BioLife Solutions).Before scRNA-seq, frozen samples were thawed in a C bath for minute and digested to obtain single-cell suspensions, as described above. Single-cell suspensions of each tissue in DNA LoBind tubes were placed on ice and submitted to the NUSeq Core immediately to check the viability and cell number.Cell yield and viability of the frozen and thawed samples and fresh samples were comparable and >%, as determined by the trypan blue cell viability assay.From the samples, a total of approximately , cells were collected.After checking for sample quality and filtering out dead cells, the final total cell number was ,.Overall, the contribution from each of the patients to cell clusters was comparable in terms of total cell numbers.However, we noted that each patient sample contributed variably to cell clusters in endometrial and adenomyotic issues.The contribution came primarily from a single patient in extremely small clusters: endometrial clusters (progenitor and T-cell) and adenomyotic cluster (neuron-like).Data from these clusters were excluded from our analyses.Due to high cell yield, suspensions were diluted before sequencing to obtain the target cell concentration.Single-cell suspensions from adenomyotic uteri with approximately % cell viability was used as input material with an optimal cell concentration of - cells/mL.Samples then were processed for construction of \\u00c2 libraries for sequencing using the \\u00c2 Genomics Single-Cell reagent kit protocol.Samples were loaded onto the \\u00c2 Genomics Chromium platform to generate single-cell gel beads in emulsion.Cells underwent reverse transcription reactions to generate barcoded cDNA, which shares a \\u00c2 barcode with all cDNA from its individual cell of origin.Subsequently, the gel beads in emulsion were broken, and all uniquely barcoded cDNAs were pooled and amplified by polymerase chain reaction to generate material for sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq at a depth of average , reads per cell. Pre-processing and integration.Processed data from the Cell Ranger pipeline was analyzed using the R package Seurat (v.) as described previously () .Quality control analysis was performed before data integration.Cells with % gene counts and cells with >% mitochondrial RNA content were filtered out to remove low-quality cells.After log normalization of the filtered data from the patients, data were aligned using the FindIntegrationAnchors and Integra-teData functions to remove batch effects.This process was performed for data from adenomyosis, endometrium, and myometrium samples separately to identify and compare tissue-specific cell types. Cell clustering, visualization, and cell-type annotation.After scaling with a coefficient and regressing out the effects of mitochondrial genes and the cell cycle effect (S Scores and iG Scores), principal component analysis was performed with principal components and a default resolution parameter using the FindCluster function.Identified cell clusters were visualized by a nonlinear dimensionality reduction algorithm, UMAP.To identify the cell type of each cluster, canonical cell marker gene information was collected from the published Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of adenomyosis tissue.(A) UMAP presentation of adenomyotic cell clusters.There is a larger and more heterogeneous group of fibroblast-like cells than endometrial fibroblasts (see Fig. ).In contrast to endometrial tissue, there is no readily recognizable connection between the pericyte progenitors and fibroblast-like cells.(B) Fibroblasts comprised a much larger portion (%) of adenomyosis, compared with endometrial fibroblast population (%, see Fig. ).In contrast, epithelial cells made up only % of adenomyosis versus % of endometrial tissue (see Fig. literature, then marker genes for every cluster were identified using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test option of the FindAll-Markers function, and clusters were annotated based on the presence of reference marker genes in these clusters. Pseudotime, DoRothEA, PROGENy, and gene enrichment analyses.After transferring Seurat-generated cluster embeddings into a monocle object, pseudotime analysis was performed on the fibroblast-like cell clusters using monocle (v..) () .Transcription factor (TF) enrichment analysis was performed on fibroblast-like cell clusters of all tissues using the discriminant regulon expression analysis tool, DoRo-thEA (v), which is a curated resource of TFs and their transcriptional targets () .First, regulons with A-C confidence level were selected for the analysis, then the most variable TFs in selected clusters were visualized.Pathway activities of selected clusters were estimated by PROGENy, which infers pathway activity from perturbation experiments () .Gene ontology terms for differentially upregulated genes in unciliated epithelial cells in adenomyosis and endometrium samples were identified using cluster Profiler on Gene Set Enrichment Analysis using the gseGO function for all ontologies.Normalized enrichment scores were calculated for enrichment after correcting for multiple testing with the Benjamini-Hochberg method.Dot plots were generated to show significant GO terms based on their p-adjusted value and Gene Ratio, derived by dividing the total number of genes in the gene set by the number of overlapping genes.In these pathway analyses, we excluded the clusters that originated primarily from the tissue of from a single patient; i.e., E and E from endometrium and A from adenomyosis (see Figs. E, C ). We identified cell clusters comprised of distinct cell types shown in the UMAP: unciliated ( clusters) and ciliated epithelial cells, endothelial cells ( clusters), fibroblast-like cells ( clusters), activated fibroblasts, pericytes, vascular smooth muscle cells, NK cells, T cells ( clusters), B cells, macrophages, monocytes, and potential progenitor cells (Fig. B ) The top markers for each cell type are shown in a dot blot (Fig. C ), and the top markers for each cluster are shown in a detailed heatmap (Supplemental Fig. a ). Unciliated epithelial cells organized in clusters (E, E, E) comprised % of the endometrium.Epithelial cells were identified with canonical markers including EPCAM, PAEP, MMP, and KRT.We also identified one ciliated epithelial cell cluster, which expresses cilia-associated genes (C), such as RSPH, AGR, and PIFO; this cell type was described recently in a study performing scRNA-seq of normal endometrium (; Figs. B-D ). Endothelial cells expressed PECAM, SOX and CLDN and were present in clusters (E, E, E), which constituted % of endometrium (Figs. B-D ). Immune cells constituted of % of endometrium.The dominant immune cells were NK cells (%) expressing NKG and GNLY) and T cells (%) expressing CDD and CD.Macrophages and monocytes were identified based on CD and HLA-DRA expression.A very small B cell cluster also was present (%), which expressed CDA and IGKC (Figs. B-D ). Fibroblast-like cells constituted the majority of the endometrium (%).We identified closely grouped clusters of fibroblast-like cells (E, E, E, E), which express collagen and matrix-related genes (Figs. B-D ).When comparing endometrial tissues across the patients, all tissues contained the majority of cellular clusters, although at varying levels (Fig. E ). Fibroblast clusters E and E had similar gene expression profiles, with both expressing SFRP, COLA, LUM, MMP, SFRP, ECM, and IGF (Fig. F ).Feature plots also revealed that both clusters also expressed MME, ESR, and PGR, which are expressed by endometrial stromal fibroblasts (Fig. G ).Cluster E showed high expression of adhesion-related genes, such as WISP, CCDC, GSN, OGN, and SERPINF.Cluster E was slightly segregated from the group and uniquely expressed differentiation and mitogenesis-related genes, such as FOSB, EGR, NRA, FOS, RO RB, THBS, ESR, JUN, and PDGFRA.Among all fibroblast-like cells, ESR expression was the highest in cluster E, which we identified as differentiated fibroblasts.Some of the key genes expressed in the fibroblast-like populations are shown as feature plots in Figures F and G . A distinct cluster (E) that closely mapped to fibroblasts showed unique expression of the pericyte markers COXI, MCAM, NOTCH, and PDGFRB.Attached to E was a vascular smooth muscle cell cluster (E) expressing markers, such as MYL, TINAGL, BCAM, MYH, MYLK, and ACTA (Fig. F ).Because stem/progenitor type cells were detected consistently among pericytes, we performed a pseudotime analysis starting from cluster E () .Intriguingly, the differentiation trajectory initiating from pericytes progressed through fibroblast-like cells in E and E, then through actively differentiating fibroblast-like cells (E) and ended in ciliated epithelium (E; Fig. H ).Endometrial mesenchymal stem cells were reported previously to be clonogenic and multipotent pericytes, which may respond to conditions during endometrial regeneration () .Therefore, our findings suggest that fibroblast-like cells might originate from pericytes with mesenchymal stem cell characteristics.The scRNA-seq data also suggested that ciliated epithelial cells may be derived from pericytes through mesenchymalepithelial transition (MET; Fig. H ).The PROGENy analysis of this MET trajectory showed that distinct signaling pathways, namely PIK and P, were upregulated in differentiated fibroblast-like cells (E) and the ciliated epithelial cluster (E), respectively (Fig. I ).We also used DoRothEA to examine differential expression of TFs in MET differentiation trajectories (E/E/E/E/E), which is detailed in Supplemental Fig. b (available online). We identified clusters including cell types in adenomyotic tissue, as shown in UMAP (Fig. A ).Compared with endometrium, adenomyotic tissue had a higher proportion of fibroblasts and lower proportion of epithelial cells.Fibroblastlike cells constituted % of the tissue and showed a high degree of heterogeneity, gathering in distinct clusters (A, A, A, A, A, A).A smooth muscle cell cluster (A), which closely grouped with the fibroblast populations, constituted % of adenomyotic tissue.Epithelial cells constituted % of the tissue including ciliated and unciliated epithelium (A, A; Figs. A, B ).Unlike endometrium, we identified a small neuron-like cluster (A) grouped with fibroblast-like cells and a cluster with myeloid progenitor cells grouped with mast cells (A).The relative contributions of each cluster per patient and the top gene markers for each cell type are shown in Figures C and D and Supplemental Figure a (available online).Immune cells constituted % of adenomyosis, compared with % in endometrium.Macrophages and monocytes constituted % of cells in adenomyotic tissue followed by T cells (%) and NK cells (%).Endothelial cells constituted approximately % of the tissue (A, A, A), with a small cluster including lymphatic endothelial cells (A).In contrast with endometrium, pericytes (A) and vascular smooth muscle cells (A) clustered separately from the fibroblast-like cells.Similar to the endometrium, we identified a potential progenitor cell cluster (A), which associated closely with fibroblast-like cells and constituted % of adenomyotic tissue (Figs. A, B ). The fibroblast-like clusters A, A, A, A and A showed transcriptomic similarities and represented a group distinct from A, which was uniquely enriched in smooth muscle cell markers, and A that had a strong signature for extracellular matrix-related genes (Fig. E ).In A, a TF analysis demonstrated increased activity of ESR, ETS, FLI, and FOXL (Supplemental Fig. b ), whereas PROGENy showed activation of the MAPK and EGFR pathways, both of which are associated with cell proliferation (Fig. H ).The neighboring A cluster had high expression of PDGFRA, COLA, MME, ESR, RORB and HAND, classical markers for mesenchymal progenitors as well as endometrial stromal cells (Fig. E ).The PDGFRA together with ESR genes were expressed in A, suggestive of actively proliferating and differentiating mesenchymal cells driven by estrogen.Interestingly, A showed a pattern of maximum ESR expression indicative of high estrogen responsiveness, whereas the highest PGR expression was seen in A and A (Fig. F ).This pattern of progression of ESR/PGR expression is consistent with a pseudotime analysis showing differentiation in the direction of A/A/A/A (Figs. F, G ).The TF analysis suggested that A and A have increased ATF activity, which is related to cellular response to injury, and A showed MXI and THAP upregulation, which are related with pluripotency and mesenchymal cell differentiation (Supplemental Fig. b ). Cluster A showed clear expression of smooth muscle cell markers, such as ACTA, DES, ACTG, and MYLK; therefore, we identified it as the smooth muscle cells (SMCs) cluster (Fig. E ).Pseudotime analysis suggested that this SMC cluster seems to originate from an adenomyotic fibroblast cluster after a differentiation pattern of A/A/A/A/A (Fig. G ).The TF analysis of A showed high activity of MEFA, TEAD, and SMAD, which are associated with EMT regulation and muscle hypertrophy.Matrix gla protein (MGP) was the top marker in A; these cells showed high expression of genes associated with matrix remodeling including decorin (DCN), which is a collagen binding proteoglycan of extracellular matrix, asporin (ASPN), which has a key role in osteoblast driven collagen mineralization activity, and other genes related to macrophage response, such as AEBP.The TFs associated with immune response (STAT, SPI) and muscle hypertrophy (SMAD), and the related TNF and NFKB pathways, were predicted to be activated in this cluster (Supplemental Fig. b ).The MGP-expressing A cluster may represent terminally differentiated fibroblasts that are resident in adenomyosis. In the fibroblast-like cell population, the pseudotime analysis initiated from A showed a pro-proliferative transcriptomic profile similar to that of the small progenitor cluster (A, Fig. E ); the differentiation trajectory diffusely transitioned via A, A, A, and A, and segregated to reach clear end points, namely A (SMCs) and A (fibroblast-like cells expressing matrix-associated genes including MGP, thus designated MGP fibroblast-like; Fig. G ).Intriguingly, this analysis also demonstrated a trajectory between the small progenitor cluster (A) and the entire congregated fibroblast-like population (Fig. G ).A expressed mitosis and cell division-associated genes and was closely related transcriptomically to the progenitor cluster E in endometrium.Fibroblast-like cells were clustered tightly in adenomyosis, and unlike endometrial tissue, pericytes (A) and vascular SMCs (A) were not linked directly to this fibroblast-like population (Figs. B, A ).A pseudotime analysis starting from pericytes did not show a continuation to fibroblast-like cells in adenomyotic tissue. Overall, there were clusters including cell types in myometrium (Supplemental Fig. a , available online).As in endometrium and adenomyosis, the dominant cell type in myometrium comprised closely bundled fibroblast-like cell clusters (%), followed by SMCs (%; Supplemental Fig. b ).Intriguingly, there were small clusters of epithelial cells (<%) in myometrium (M, M) and clusters of endothelial cells (M, M, M) including a lymphatic endothelial cell cluster (M).Similar to endometrium and adenomyosis, pericytes (M) and vascular SMCs (M, M) clustered together.T cells made up the dominant immune cell cluster, similar to endometrium, followed by macrophages and monocytes.Relative contributions of clusters by each patient are shown in (Supplemental Fig. c ). The fibroblast-like cells in myometrial tissue were comprised of a close group of clusters (M, M, M, M, M).We performed subcluster analysis on these groups, as demonstrated in a heatmap (Supplemental Fig. d ).The OGN, CTGF, CYR, and LUM genes were the top markers in M; these genes are associated with collagen formation and remodeling () () () .Cluster M showed similarity to M, which uniquely expressed MGP and was designated a ''MGP fibroblast-like'' cluster, similar to A (Fig. E ).Cluster M also showed high expression of matrix-associated proteins, such as gelsolin (GSN), decorin (DCN), and fibulin- (FBLN) () . Fibroblast clusters M and M had high expression of MMP, SFRP, CRABP, and VCAN; however, unlike M, M also showed upregulation of WNT, ECM, and COLA as well as retinoic acid metabolism-associated genes, such as ALDHA, RORB, and RBP ().The MDK gene, another highly expressed gene in M, encodes a protein that responds to retinoic acid and promotes cell survival, migration, and tumorigenesis () .Cluster M was distinct from all other clusters and showed a unique gene expression profile of differentiation and early response genes, such as FOS, JUN, and EGR () .The PROGENy analysis showed upregulation of hypoxia, TGFB, P, NFkB, TNF, and JAK-STAT pathways in M (MGP fibroblast-like cells), similar to A in adenomyosis (Supplemental Fig. e and Fig. H ).A pseudotime analysis originating from the myometrial fibroblast cluster M showed a differentiation map through M and M that ended in M (MGP fibroblast-like cells; Supplemental Fig. f ), similar to adenomyosis fibroblasts (Fig. G ).Cluster-specific markers and a list of regulatory TFs in fibroblast-like cell clusters in myometrium are shown in a detailed heatmap (Supplemental Figs. a, b , available online). We also interrogated the similarities and the differences between the SMC clusters M and M and the SMC cluster (A) in adenomyosis (Supplemental Fig. c ).The transcriptomic profiles of M and A are quite similar with high expression of SFRP, a modulator of the WNT pathway (Supplemental Fig. c ).These data collectively suggest that in myometrial and adenomyotic tissues, SMCs likely originate from a fibroblast-like cluster. We next evaluated differential gene expression patterns in fibroblast clusters that distinguish adenomyosis from endometrium and myometrium (Figs. A, B ).Among the fibroblast-like clusters in adenomyosis and endometrium, the most striking observation was that A is very similar to E and E endometrial fibroblasts (Fig. A ).This suggested that A fibroblasts represent a population that migrated from endometrium to invade myometrial tissue and contributed to adenomyosis (see Figs. B, A ).Pseudotime analyses suggested that A, E, and E all have progenitor-like features, from which more differentiated fibroblasts originate (see Figs. H, G ). When adenomyotic and myometrial fibroblast clusters were compared (Fig. B ), A showed striking similarities to M and M, all of which expressed the highest levels of MGP and seemed to represent a terminally differentiated population among the fibroblast-like clusters in each tissue (see Fig. G and Supplemental Fig. f ).The MGP is a structural extracellular matrix constituent () , and our finding resonates with the observed increase in extracellular matrix in adenomyotic tissue. Intriguingly, the gene family SFRP, which are modulators of the WNT pathway, were expressed prominently in fibroblast-like clusters, showing cross-tissue similarities between the endometrium, adenomyosis, and myometrium (Figs. A, B ).Therefore, we first determined the differential expression of the members of this gene family across the tissues (Fig. C ).Both SFRP and SFRP levels were higher in adenomyosis than in endometrium or myometrium (Fig. C ).Gene SFRP was expressed only in adenomyosis and myometrium (A, M; Figs. A-C ).It has been reported that SFRP, which is a WNT antagonist, downregulates estrogen-dependent b-catenin activity, inhibits cell growth, and promotes myogenesis () .The lack of SFRP expression in endometrium might permit epithelial cell growth and invasiveness.Thus, SFRP might be a key predictive marker of epithelial cell growth potential in adenomyosis.Interestingly, SFRP and SFRP are expressed in all fibroblast-like clusters in adenomyosis, whereas SFRP is expressed only in A (Fig. D ). The cells in clusters A, A, A, and A seemed to be distinct within adenomyotic tissue (Figs. A, B ); analysis of adenomyotic fibroblast-like cells showed uniquely upregulated genes involved in the WNT pathway, ribosome biogenesis, and protein targeting to endoplasmic reticulum (Supplemental Fig. , available online).Expression of genes in the ribosome biogenesis pathway was strikingly prominent in A.Ribosome biogenesis is an established pathway that supports tumor cell growth and proliferation () . The epithelium represents the defining cell type in adenomyosis, and adenomyosis is thought to originate from the endometrium.Therefore, we further analyzed differentially expressed genes in epithelial cells between matched adenomyotic tissue and endometrium () .First, we used scatter plot analysis to define the ciliated and unciliated epithelial cells in our tissues (Fig. A ).As expected, classical markers, such as PAEP and MMP, were conspicuously higher in unciliated epithelial cells, whereas a much larger number of genes were prominently expressed in ciliated epithelial cells (Fig. A ) () .Then, we identified differentially expressed genes separately in unciliated and ciliated epithelia in adenomyosis and endometrium (Figs. B, C ).In general, unciliated and ciliated epithelium in adenomyotic tissue and endometrium showed similar transcriptomic profiles.In unciliated epithelium, however, expression of a number of genes was significantly higher in endometrium, including markers of differentiation, such as PAEP, PLCG, HSPAA, and HSPAA (Fig. B ).The PAEP marker, also known as glycodelin, is a secretory glycoprotein that is regulated by progesterone and associated with differentiation and healthy implantation (, ) .This finding may suggest the presence of progesterone resistance in adenomyotic unciliated epithelium (, ) .In unciliated and ciliated epithelial cells, expression of heat shock proteins (HSPAA, HSPAA) was significantly lower in adenomyosis than in endometrium (Figs. B, C ).Because some heat shock proteins are important for estrogen action, which seems to have a role in adenomyosis () , this finding requires further investigation. We also noted that immune function-related genes and pathways are upregulated in unciliated epithelial cells of adenomyosis compared with endometrium (Figs. B, D ).Expression of genes associated with immune response and macrophage activation, such as HLA-DRA, HLA-DRB, CD, NFKBIA, and SA, were significantly higher in adenomyotic epithelium (Fig. B ).These genes also are related to cell proliferation, inflammation, and cell motility.Among the upregulated pathways in adenomyosis, immune response-related processes were significantly upregulated in adenomyosis in ciliated and unciliated epithelium (Fig. D ).Moreover, genes involved in the canonical WNT signaling pathway and regulation of epithelial cell migration pathways were upregulated only in adenomyotic unciliated epithelium. In our analysis, WNT signaling emerged as a prominent biological process that was differentially regulated in stromal, epithelial, and SMCs; thus, we performed bioinformatics to further analyze paracrine and intracrine WNT-related interactions between all cell types in adenomyotic tissue (cellcell communication analysis, Fig. E ) The WNT signaling network analysis identified multiple signals originating from fibroblast clusters A, A, A, and A toward epithelial and endothelial clusters A, A, A, and A (Fig. E ).The directionality of signals from stromal cells toward endothelial and epithelial cells is supported by the distribution of expression of ligands (WNT) and their receptors (FZD and LRP) in each cluster (Fig. F ).In particular, WNT and WNT were expressed prominently in adenomyosis-specific fibroblastlike clusters, such as A, A, A, and A (Fig. F ; see Fig. ).The most prominent WNT receptors expressed in endothelial or epithelial cells were FZD and LRP.In summary, our scRNA-seq analysis uncovered significant roles of various fibroblast populations in endometrium and adenomyosis that seem to have central roles in adenomyosis pathophysiology via WNT signaling to endothelial and epithelial cells. To our knowledge, this is the first detailed characterization of the transcriptomic landscape of the adenomyotic uterus using scRNA-seq to compare gene expression in distinct cell types of matched endometrium, adenomyotic tissue, and myometrium.We identified ciliated and unciliated epithelial cells, fibroblast-like cells, SMCs, endothelial cells, pericytes, vascular SMCs, potential progenitor cells, T cells, NK cells, B cells, macrophages, and monocytes, as well as small clusters including neurons and myeloid progenitors in the adenomyotic uterus.Our analyses revealed a high degree of heterogeneity in fibroblast-like cells in the adenomyotic uterus.This heterogeneity may be due to different transcriptional states driven by inflammation and fibrosis in adenomyosis.We identified fibroblast-like cell clusters that we suspect represent a disease-specific transcriptome (A, A, A, and A; Figs. A, B ). The pathophysiology of adenomyosis has been debated; however, current evidence suggests that adenomyosis occurs after the invasion of the myometrium by cellular oligoclones comprised of deep glandular epithelial cells with KRAS mutations together with attached endometrial stromal cells (, ) .The lack of a substantial difference between epithelial cells in adenomyotic tissue and endometrium in our study supports this theory.Progesterone resistance has been demonstrated in adenomyotic tissue; Inuoe et al. () linked progesterone resistance to autonomously activated KRAS.Overall progesterone receptor (PGR) levels have been reported to be lower in adenomyosis compared to normal endometrium () ; however, we here identified higher PGR expression in distinct populations of fibroblast-like cells in adenomyotic tissue than in endometrium and myometrium, suggesting that progesterone resistance at the level of stromal cells is mediated by complex cellular and molecular mechanisms (Supplemental Fig. , available online).On the other hand, epithelial cells in adenomyotic tissue showed downregulation of PAEP compared with epithelial cells in endometrium; PAEP is an important progesterone-responsive gene (, ) .This is suggestive that progesterone action in the context of a stromal-epithelial paracrine interaction may be deficient in adenomyosis (, ) . The first study comparing eutopic endometrial tissues of women with or without adenomyosis identified differentially expressed genes, which might initiate the disease pathways including eukaryotic initiation factor signaling, oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and estrogen receptor signaling () .This study was based on microarray analysis and suggested that these abnormalities might be associated with the invasion of myometrial tissue by endometrial cells () .A more recent study used bulk RNA sequencing to identify differentially expressed genes and molecular pathways in the eutopic endometrium from adenomyosis patients () .These investigators found that IL- and ERK/MAPKrelated pathways were activated in the eutopic endometrium of adenomyotic uterine tissues () .A different study also identified the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway in association with the proliferation of uterine SMCs in women with adenomyosis () . The WNT pathway has been studied in the pathophysiology of adenomyosis (); however, cell-specific details of its role have not been well understood.Here, we identified an intricate WNT signaling network between fibroblast-like cells and epithelial and endothelial cells in adenomyosis (Fig. E ).Differentially expressed gene analysis in fibroblast-like cells from different tissues showed significant differences in expression of SFRP family members, which modulate WNT signaling (Figs. A, B ).The SFRPs antagonize WNT signaling by competing with WNT proteins for receptor binding () .We found that SFRPs are upregulated in fibroblast-like cells of adenomyosis compared with endometrium and normal-appearing myometrium, and that fibroblast-like cells in adenomyotic tissue express significantly higher SFRP and SFRP.Moreover, the WNT pathway is regulated at another level with increased signaling from fibroblast-like cells to epithelial cells (Figs. E, F ).This is suggestive that WNT activity may be upregulated in epithelial cells and downregulated via SFRPs in fibroblasts in adenomyotic tissue. Another recent study compared endometrial and myometrial tissues of women with or without diffuse adenomyosis at the transcriptomic level () .These investigators found that biological processes, including inflammation, extracellular matrix organization, collagen degradation, hyaluronan synthesis, and cell migration, were upregulated in adenomyosis.In the myometrial compartment, top biological processes in women with adenomyosis were extracellular matrix dysfunction, abnormal sensory pain perception, and g-aminobutyric acid synaptic transmission () .We also identified a unique cluster in adenomyosis (A) that has a strong signature for extracellular matrix-related genes (Fig. E ). There are some limitations to our study.Despite being a powerful approach to establishing the transcriptomic profile of individual cells in heterogenous cell populations, singlecell sequencing has drawbacks () .Single-cell sequencing technology allows assessment of heterogeneity in complex tissues, but low coverage prevents detection of mutations () .Thus, a major limitation of our study is a lack of mutation information.Additionally, we did not identify cell surface markers and, thus, could not sort cells to verify the identities or functions of the cell clusters.Because adenomyosis is a disease that develops within the myometrium, we originally expected to see a higher number of SMCs but found a higher complement of fibroblasts compared with SMCs.A potential explanation is that fibroblast-like cells were more easily digested than SMCs, and thus a higher number of fibroblast-like cells than SMCs were prepared and analyzed.Our findings, on the other hand, also may reflect the in vivo nature of myometrial tissue.In fact, a recent scRNA-seq analysis of the myometrium identified fibroblasts as a major component of this tissue () .Nevertheless, the comparative transcriptomic analysis of matched endometrium, adjacent myometrium, and adenomyotic tissue within the same uteri obtained from patients via scRNA-seq is a significant strength of our study.The only other study using scRNA-seq to evaluate adenomyosis used a single patient and did not provide any comparative information regarding normal-appearing myometrium of the adenomyotic uterus () . In conclusion, adenomyosis is a complex pathology associated with elaborate molecular mechanisms characterized by estrogen-dependent chronic inflammation, progesterone resistance, and epithelial KRAS mutations () .Recent DNA-based evidence provided irrefutable support that adenomyotic lesions originate from adjacent endometrial tissue; thus, the theory of entrapped endometrium as the origin of adenomyosis pertains () .Here, we used a cutting-edge procedure to define gene expression profiles of the individual cell types in adenomyotic tissue and adjacent endometrium and myometrium in an attempt to ascertain the cell-cell interactions and the key signaling pathways involved in the pathophysiology of adenomyosis.The WNT pathway turned out to be a candidate regulator of the critical biological processes in adenomyosis.We anticipate that our findings may facilitate the identification of new therapeutic targets for adenomyosis. Fertility and Sterility\\u00ae\",\n          \"Bladder dysfunction is a common complication following radical hysterectomy, caused by the damage to pelvic autonomic nerves that innervate the muscles of the bladder, urethral sphincter, and pelvic floor fasciae.Bladder dysfunction increases the rates of urinary tract infection, hospital visits or admission, and patient dissatisfaction.In addition, bladder dysfunction can also negatively impact patient quality of life (QoL).Several postoperative interventions have been proposed to prevent bladder dysfunction following radical hysterectomy.To our knowledge, there has been no systematic review evaluating the e ectiveness and safety of these interventions for preventing bladder dysfunction following radical hysterectomy in women with cervical cancer. To evaluate the e ectiveness and safety of postoperative interventions for preventing bladder dysfunction following radical hysterectomy in women with early-stage cervical cancer (stage IA to IIA). We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; , Issue ) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE via Ovid ( to April week , ), and Embase via Ovid ( Ovid ( to , week , week ).We also checked registers of clinical trials, grey literature, conference reports, and citation lists of included studies. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the e ectiveness and safety of any type of postoperative interventions for preventing bladder dysfunction following a radical hysterectomy in women with stage IA to IIA cervical cancer. Two review authors independently selected potentially relevant RCTs, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, compared results, and made judgments on the quality and certainty of the evidence.We resolved any disagreements through discussion or consultation with a third review author.Outcomes of interest consisted of spontaneous voiding recovery one week a er the operation, quality of life (QoL), adverse events, post-void residual urine volume one month a er the operation, urinary tract infection over the one month following the operation, and subjective urinary symptoms. None of the included studies reported rate of spontaneous voiding recovery one week a er surgery, time to a post-void residual volume of urine of mL or less, or post-void residual urine volume at and months a er surgery, all of which are important outcomes for assessing postoperative bladder dysfunction. Limited evidence suggested that bethanechol may minimise the risk of bladder dysfunction a er radical hysterectomy by lowering postvoid residual urine volume.The certainty of this evidence, however, was very low.The e ectiveness of di erent types of postoperative urinary catheterisation (suprapubic and intermittent self-catheterisation) remain unproven. The issue Radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy (removal of the uterus (womb) with its surrounding tissues and lymph glands in the pelvis) is the treatment for early-stage cervical cancer (when cancer is still within the cervix and upper vagina, without spread into nearby tissues).Bladder dysfunction (problems with the way the bladder holds and releases urine) is a common problem following radical hysterectomy, caused by the damage to the nerves controlling urination. To assess the usefulness and safety of treatment to prevent bladder dysfunction following radical hysterectomy in women with early-stage cervical cancer.We searched the scientific databases for randomised controlled trials (studies in which people or groups of people are allocated by chance to two or more groups, treating them di erently) published to April . We found four studies that met the inclusion criteria.One study compared a medication called bethanechol to placebo (a substance that has no therapeutic e ect, used as a control in testing drugs).Three studies compared suprapubic catheterisation (insertion of a flexible tube (catheter) into the bladder through a cut in the lower abdomen to drain urine) with intermittent self-catheterisation (insertion of a catheter via the urethra, into the bladder at intervals throughout the day). Bethanecol may reduce the chance of bladder dysfunction by lowering the volume of post-void residual urine, assessed at one month a er surgery.However, the certainty of this evidence is very low and further studies have the potential to better inform this outcome.*The risk in the intervention group (and its % confidence interval) is based on the assumed risk in the comparison group and the relative effect of the intervention (and its % CI).CI: confidence interval; MD: mean difference; RR: risk ratio GRADE Working Group grades of evidence High certainty: we are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect Moderate certainty: we are moderately confident in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different Low certainty: our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect Very low certainty: we have very little confidence in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect a The evidence was downgraded by two levels due to serious imprecision (small sample size and wide CI crossing the line of no e ect). b The evidence was downgraded by one level due to indirectness (reporting adverse events of unclear severity and unclear their association with the intervention).c The evidence was downgraded by one level due to unclear risk of selection bias. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Please see Appendix for a glossary of terms. Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer a ecting women worldwide, with an estimated , new cases and , cervical cancer-related deaths globally in (Bray ) .Cervical cancer is a major health problem among women in developing countries, with almost % of the global burden and % of cervical cancer-related deaths occurring in these regions (Ferlay ; Bray ) .The high burden of cervical cancer among less economically developed settings is secondary to the failure to provide e ective, large-scale screening programmes (Torre ; Bray ). Treatment of cervical cancer depends on the extent of the disease.Appendix displays a International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging system for cervical cancer (Bhatla ) , which was revised from the FIGO staging system (Appendix ).Women with early-stage cervical cancer (FIGO stage IA to IIA) can be treated with either radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy (removal of the uterus with its surrounding tissues and lymph glands in the pelvis) or pelvic chemoradiation (radiation therapy to lower abdomen being given at the same time as chemotherapy) (Landoni ) .In premenopausal women, radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy may be preferable to pelvic radiation in order to preserve ovarian function and vaginal elasticity, as well as prevent the long-term risks of pelvic radiation (Cull ; Viswanathan ) . The aim of radical hysterectomy is to remove the primary tumour with an adequate margin of normal tissue to ensure complete resection (Piver ; Querleu ; Verleye ) .Appendix lists details of the three systems for the classification of radical hysterectomy (Piver-Rutledge-Smith, Gynecological Cancer Group of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer, and Querleu and Morrow).The stage of cervical cancer is the fundamental factor to be taken into consideration when considering radical hysterectomy.Women with early-stage cervical cancer are traditionally treated with Piver type III radical hysterectomy.However, a previous randomised controlled trial (RCT) demonstrated that women with early-stage cervical cancer who underwent Piver type II hysterectomy (also called modified radical hysterectomy) had comparable oncological outcomes to those who underwent type III hysterectomy (Landoni ) .Pelvic lymphadenectomy is performed to look for metastatic lesions in the pelvic lymph nodes.The survival of women with earlystage cervical cancer who undergo radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy is excellent.Estimated five-year survival rates range between % and % (Kim ; Suprasert ; Srisomboon ; Mahawerawat ) . One of the most distressing morbidities that can occur following radical hysterectomy is bladder dysfunction (problems with the way the bladder holds and releases urine) (Lin ; Plotti ; Laterza ) .The incidence of bladder dysfunction a er radical hysterectomy varies from % to % depending on the method used in evaluating bladder dysfunction and the duration of follow-up (Zullo ; Wit ) .In addition, the risk of bladder dysfunction depends on the extent of surgery.Women undergoing type II radical hysterectomy are at lower risk of postoperative bladder dysfunction than those who undergo type III radical hysterectomy (Landoni ; Raspagliesi ) .By magnifying anatomical structures in the pelvis, laparoscopic approaches may help reduce the denervation of pelvic nerves during radical hysterectomy.However, it has yet to be shown that these approaches have a significant e ect on the prevention of bladder dysfunction (Laterza ; Kietpeerakool ) .Minimally invasive radical hysterectomy, however, is associated with inferior survival to laparotomy radical hysterectomy in women with earlystage cervical cancer.Consequently, a minimally invasive radical hysterectomy is not recommended.Although there may be a selective group of women for whom minimally invasive radical hysterectomy remains safe, further studies are needed (Ramirez ; Cusimano ; Chen ). Causes of bladder dysfunction following radical hysterectomy are secondary to the damage of pelvic autonomic nerves that innervate the muscles of the bladder (detrusor muscle), urethral sphincter and pelvic floor fasciae (Zullo ; Sellers ) .Bladder dysfunction following radical hysterectomy includes various functional disorders of the lower urinary tract, such as urinary retention, voiding di iculty, urinary hesitancy, urinary tract infection, and urinary stress incontinence (Chen ) . Bladder dysfunction increases the rates of urinary tract infection, hospital visits or admission, patient dissatisfaction, and the need for intermittent self-catheterisation (Manchana ) .Bladder dysfunction can also negatively impact patient quality of life (QoL), which can lead to embarrassment or even social isolation (Zhou ). Previous studies have demonstrated that a malfunctioning bladder detrusor muscle is a major cause of bladder dysfunction following radical hysterectomy (Plotti ; Laterza ) .Contraction of the detrusor muscle of the urinary bladder is stimulated by parasympathetic nerve impulses mediated by the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (Sellers ).Pharmacological therapy for voiding disorders consists of drugs that improve detrusor muscle contraction and those that reduce urethral resistance, which may have a role in the prevention of postoperative bladder dysfunction. Bethanechol, a cholinergic agent, is a synthetic ester, and is structurally and pharmacologically related to acetylcholine.Bethanechol increases the tone of the detrusor muscle by Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews stimulating the parasympathetic nervous system (Kemp ; Madeiro ) . Cisapride is a prokinetic agent.It is principally prescribed for treating gastro-oesophageal reflux in children.The mechanism of action of cisapride is to stimulate the release of acetylcholine, thus promoting detrusor muscle contractility.Hence, as a result of its parasympathomimetic e ect, cisapride may be e ective for treating bladder hypotonia a er surgery (Madeiro ) .Cisapride, however, has been restricted to a limited access programme in the USA and Europe because it is associated with serious side e ects, including cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heart rhythms) and death (Henney ) . Suprapubic catheterisation (SPC), an insertion of a catheter via postoperative suprapubic cystostomy, has been proposed to hasten the recovery of bladder function compared with an indwelling urethral catheter, by minimising the risks of a urinary tract infection and asymptomatic bacteriuria, which can impede bladder function activity returning to normal (Kidd ) . Bladder training is an important form of behaviour therapy that can be e ective in treating bladder dysfunction following radical hysterectomy (Goldfarb ) To evaluate the e ectiveness and safety of postoperative interventions for preventing bladder dysfunction following radical hysterectomy in women with early-stage cervical cancer (FIGO stage IA to IIA). Criteria for considering studies for this review We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Women We planned to include any trial that attempted to compare the following. \\u2022 A pharmacological agent and placebo or standard care. \\u2022 Rate of spontaneous voiding recovery at one week a er surgery.We defined spontaneous voiding recovery as a voluntary void that has mL or less of urine remaining in the bladder, measured by clean intermittent catheterisation a er the woman feels as though her bladder is empty.\\u2022 Quality of life (QoL), determined using a scale that has been validated in accordance with the norms reported in a peer-reviewed publication (i.e. the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-CX cervical cancer-specific QoL questionnaire (Greimel ) ). \\u2022 Time a er surgery to a post-void residual urine volume of mL or less (days).Post-void residual urine was defined as the amount of urine retained in the bladder a er a voluntary void, measured by clean intermittent catheterisation a er the participant feels as though bladder is empty.We planned to present a 'Summary of findings' table reporting the following outcomes listed in order of priority. \\u2022 Rate of spontaneous voiding recovery at one week a er surgery. \\u2022 QoL. \\u2022 Time a er surgery to a post-void residual urine volume of mL or less (days).\\u2022 Adverse events. \\u2022 Post-void residual urine volume one month a er surgery. \\u2022 Urinary tract infections in the first month a er surgery. \\u2022 Subjective urinary symptoms. We included only randomised controlled trials (RCTs), irrespective of the language of publication, publication status or sample size. We searched the following electronic databases on April . We searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (who.int/ictrp/en/) and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify any ongoing trials.If we identified ongoing trials that had not been published, we planned to approach the principal investigators and major co-operative groups active in this area to ask for relevant data.We searched the following databases for grey literature: Open-Grey (opengrey.eu/)and Index to theses (proquest.com/products-services/pqdt_uk_ireland.html). We handsearched reports of conferences from the following sources. \\u2022 Annual Meeting of the Society of Gynecologic Oncology. \\u2022 Annual Meeting of the International Gynecologic Cancer Society. \\u2022 Annual Meeting of the European Society of Medical Oncology. \\u2022 Annual Meeting of the British Gynaecological Cancer Society. \\u2022 Biennial Meeting of the Asian Society of Gynecologic Oncology. \\u2022 Biennial Meeting of Asia and Oceania Federation of Obstetrics and Gynaecology. Oncology. We checked the citation lists of the included studies and key textbooks for potentially relevant references.We searched for papers in all languages and translated them, if necessary.We planned to include unpublished trials only if trial data and methodological descriptions were provided in written form or through direct contact with the trial authors. We downloaded all titles and abstracts retrieved via an electronic search of the Endnote reference management database.A er duplicates were removed, we transferred these data to Covidence (covidence.org).Two review authors (AA and CK) examined the remaining references independently.We excluded those studies which clearly did not meet the inclusion criteria, and we obtained full-text copies of potentially relevant references.Two review authors (AA and CK) independently assessed the eligibility of the retrieved reports or publications.We resolved any disagreement through discussion or, if required, we planned to consult a third review author (KG or PL).We identified and excluded duplicates and collated multiple reports of the same study so that each study, rather than each report, is the unit of interest in the review.We used the details obtained from the selection process in Covidence to complete a PRISMA flow diagram and 'Characteristics of excluded studies' table (Liberati ) . Copyright \\u00a9 The Cochrane Collaboration.Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Two review authors (AA and CK) independently extracted study characteristics and outcome data from included studies using Covidence.We noted in the 'Characteristics of included studies' table if outcome data were not reported in a usable way.We resolved disagreements by consensus or by involving a third review author (KG or TT).One review author (CK) checked study characteristics for accuracy against the trial report. For included studies, we extracted the following data. \\u2022 Author, year of publication, and journal citation (including language).\\u2022 Country. \\u2022 Setting. \\u2022 Inclusion and exclusion criteria. \\u2022 Study methodology. \\u2022 Study population and disease characteristics: \\u2022 total number enrolled; \\u2022 participant characteristics; \\u2022 age; \\u2022 co-morbidities; \\u2022 other baseline characteristics; \\u2022 percentage of participants with non-cervical cancer (only RCTs involving mixed gynaecologic malignancies); \\u2022 FIGO stage of cervical cancer; \\u2022 the histopathological subtype of cervical cancer; \\u2022 tumour size (largest tumour diameter); \\u2022 the radicality of surgery (Piver or Querleu-Morrow). \\u2022 Intervention details: \\u2022 schedule of bladder training; \\u2022 suprapubic cystostomy technique; \\u2022 acupuncture; \\u2022 cholinergic agents (dose, duration). \\u2022 placebo; \\u2022 no intervention.\\u2022 Risk of bias in the study (see below). \\u2022 Duration of follow-up. \\u2022 Outcomes: for each outcome, we extracted the outcome definition and unit of measurement (if relevant); for adjusted estimates, we recorded variables adjusted for in analyses. \\u2022 Results: we extracted the number of participants allocated to each intervention group, the total number analysed for each outcome, and the missing participants.\\u2022 Notes: funding for trial and notable conflicts of interest of trial authors. We assessed and reported on the methodological quality and risk of bias in included studies in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins ) , which recommends the explicit reporting of the following individual elements for RCTs. \\u2022 Selection bias: random sequence generation and allocation concealment. \\u2022 Performance bias: blinding of participants and personnel (treatment providers).\\u2022 Detection bias: blinding of outcome assessment. \\u2022 Attrition bias: incomplete outcome data. \\u2022 Reporting bias: selective reporting of outcomes. \\u2022 Other possible bias. We considered outcome data as complete if at least % of participants underwent follow-ups and were assessed for primary outcomes.Two review authors (AA and CK) independently applied the 'Risk of bias' tool and resolved di erences by discussion or by appeal to a third review author (KG or PL).We judged each item as being at high, low or unclear risk of bias as set out in the criteria displayed in Appendix . We provided a quote from the study report or a statement, or both, as justification for our judgement for each item in the 'Risk of bias' table.We summarised results in both a 'Risk of bias' graph and a 'Risk of bias' summary.When interpreting treatment e ects and meta-analyses, we took into account the risk of bias in the studies that contribute to that outcome.Where information on risk of bias relates to unpublished data or correspondence with trial authors, we planned to note this in the table. We used the following measures of the e ect of treatment. \\u2022 For dichotomous outcomes (e.g.rate of spontaneous voiding recovery one week a er surgery, rate of urethral catheter removal, rate of urinary tract infections, number of participants with normal detrusor pressure at maximum flow, adverse events), we analysed data based on the number of events and the number of women assessed in the intervention and comparison groups.We used these to calculate the risk ratio and % confidence interval.\\u2022 For continuous outcomes (e.g.duration of postoperative retained urethral catheterisation, post-void residual urine volume and QoL measures), we analysed data based on the means, standard deviations and number of women assessed for both the intervention and comparison groups to calculate the mean di erences between treatment arms with their % confidence intervals.If the mean di erence was reported without individual group data, we used this to report the study results.If more than one study measured the same outcome using di erent tools, we calculated the standardised mean di erence and % confidence interval using the inverse variance method.\\u2022 For time-to-event data (e.g.time a er surgery to a post-void residual urine volume of mL or less), we planned to extract the log of the hazard ratio (log HR ) and its standard error from trial reports.If these were not reported, we planned to estimate the log HR and its standard error using the methods of Parmar . We included studies in which individual women were randomised. In a study with multiple intervention groups, we planned to combine all relevant experimental intervention groups into a single group to create a single pair-wise comparison, where possible (Higgins ) . Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. We planned to contact the original investigators to request missing data.If we could not contact the investigators or could not obtain the requested missing data, we planned to analyse only the available data and not to impute missing outcome data for any of the outcomes. We clinically assessed heterogeneity by visual inspection of forest plots.We assessed statistical heterogeneity in each meta-analysis using the I statistic and Chi test (Higgins ) .We regarded heterogeneity as substantial if the I statistic value was greater than % or there was a low P value (< .) in the Chi test for heterogeneity (Deeks ; Higgins ) .If there was substantial statistical heterogeneity, we planned to carry out subgroup analyses to assess di erences among the included studies.However, if there was both clinical and methodological heterogeneity across included studies, we planned to not report pooled results from meta-analysis, but instead use a narrative approach to data synthesis. See Di erences between protocol and review. We were unable to assess reporting bias, as only four studies met our inclusion criteria. We applied the random-e ects model with inverse variance weighting for all meta-analyses (DeSimonian ).We performed statistical analysis using Review Manager . (Review Manager ). \\u2022 For time-to-event data, we planned to pool hazard ratios using the generic inverse variance.\\u2022 For any dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the risk ratios for each study and then pooled them.\\u2022 For continuous outcomes, we pooled the mean di erences among the treatment arms, if all trials measure the outcome on the same scale; otherwise we planned to pool standardised mean di erences See Di erences between protocol and review. We intended to carry out subgroup analyses in order to assess the e ect of the following factors. \\u2022 Tumour size ( cm or less versus more than cm). \\u2022 Surgical approach (laparotomy versus minimally invasive surgery).\\u2022 Nerve-sparing approach during a radical hysterectomy (yes versus no).We planned to assess subgroup di erences using the interaction tests available within Review Manager .We planned to report the results of subgroup analyses by quoting the Chi statistic and P value, the interaction test, and the I statistic.However, we did not perform subgroup analysis, as most analyses were based on only one or two included studies.Nevertheless, we acknowledged these factors in the interpretation of review findings. See Di erences between protocol and review. We were unable to conduct any of the planned sensitivity analyses due to insu icient data.If more studies are included in a future update, we plan to perform sensitivity analyses in order to assess the e ect of the following factors. \\u2022 Repeating the analysis excluding unpublished studies (if any). \\u2022 Repeating the analysis excluding studies judged to be at 'high' or 'unclear' risk of bias for allocation concealment. We created Summary of findings tables to summarise the results of the meta-analyses conducted for each of the outcomes, as outlined in the section Types of outcome measures.We graded the overall certainty of the evidence for each outcome according to the GRADE approach, which takes into account issues related not only to internal validity (risk of bias, inconsistency, imprecision, publication bias) but also to external validity, such as directness of results (Langendam ) .We created a 'Summary of findings' table based on the methods described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Sch\\u00fcnemann ), and used GRADEpro GDT (Summary of findings ; Summary of findings ). \\u2022 High certainty: the true e ect lies close to that of the estimate of the e ect.\\u2022 Moderate certainty: the true e ect is likely to be close to the estimate of the e ect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially di erent.\\u2022 Low certainty: the true e ect may be substantially di erent from the estimate of the e ect.\\u2022 Very low certainty: the true e ect is likely to be substantially di erent from the estimate of e ect. We downgraded the evidence from 'high' certainty by one level for each serious (or by two for each very serious) limitation. ) .Suprapubic catheterisation consisted of insertion of a Bonanno suprapubic catheter at the time of surgery, followed by free drainage, followed by catheter removal at five to seven days a er the surgery. None of the included studies reported rate of spontaneous voiding recovery at one week a er surgery, time to a post-void residual urine volume of mL or less, post-void residual urine volume at and months a er surgery, and poor bladder compliance. Nwabineli reported time a er surgery to a post-void residual urine volume of less than mL, adverse events, and rate of urinary tract infections in the first month a er surgery. Suprasert reported time a er surgery to a post-void residual urine volume of less than mL, adverse events, and rate of urinary tract infections in the first month a er surgery. Naik reported QoL, time a er surgery to a post-void residual urine volume of less than mL, adverse events, rate of urinary tract infections in the first month a er surgery, and subjective urinary symptoms. Madeiro reported post-void residual urine volume one month a er surgery, flow rate, maximum flow rate, number of women with low maximum flow rate, number of women with low detrusor pressure at maximum flow, and bladder compliance. See Characteristics of excluded studies, Characteristics of ongoing studies, and Characteristics of studies awaiting classification. We excluded seven reports because their participants were not the population that this review aimed to assess See Characteristics of included studies table, Figure , and Figure for full details.Madeiro stated that the participants were allocated using a computerised randomisation schedule.However, they did not state the concealment process.This trial therefore was at unclear risk of selection bias. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Naik stated that the participants were randomised by drawing a sealed envelope that developed from an independent administrator, but did not state the methods of random sequence generation.Consequently, this trial was judged as having an unclear risk of selection bias. Nwabineli stated that the participants were randomised using random sampling numbers.However, they did not state the allocation concealment process.This trial therefore was at unclear risk of selection bias. Madeiro stated that all medications were provided in packages of identical appearance.Identification was only made by a standardised code.Randomisation was only revealed at the end of the trial and was controlled by an independent investigator.This trial, therefore, was at low risk of performance and detection biases. Blinding of participants and personnel was not feasible in Nwabineli , Suprasert , and Naik , which compared suprapubic catheterisation versus intermittent selfcatheterisation.However, the outcomes of interest (i.e.time a er surgery to a post-void residual urine volume less than mL, adverse events, and rate of urinary tract infections in the first month a er surgery) were unlikely to be a ected by lack of blinding of participants and personnel.Hence, we considered these studies as having a low risk of bias for this domain. All included studies were at low risk of attrition bias as they had low percentages of withdrawals and dropouts (Nwabineli ; Suprasert ; Naik ; Madeiro ).See Characteristics of included studies for the proportion of participants analysed. None of the included studies reported the rate of spontaneous voiding recovery one week a er surgery, or post-void residual urine volume at and months a er surgery.Quality of life (QoL), adverse events and subjective urinary symptoms, which are important outcomes, were rarely reported.An adverse event was assessed only in Suprasert .Naik reported QoL and subjective urinary symptoms but available data, however, were insu icient to calculate the relative measures of the e ect of interventions.Due to a lack of reported outcomes that are the elements necessary for decision-making, all included studies thus were at high risk of reporting bias (Higgins ) . There was no Information indicating other important risks of bias.Accordingly, all included studies were judged as having a low risk of bias for this domain. See: Summary of findings Bethanechol compared to placebo for preventing bladder dysfunction a er radical hysterectomy in women with early-stage cervical cancer; Summary of findings Suprapubic catheterisation compared to intermittent selfcatheterisation for preventing bladder dysfunction a er radical hysterectomy in women with early-stage cervical cancer None of the studies reported the rate of spontaneous voiding recovery one week a er surgery, time a er surgery to a postvoid residual urine volume of mL or less, post-void residual urine volume at and months a er surgery, and poor bladder compliance.Consequently, we added time a er surgery to a postvoid residual urine volume of mL or less, and mL or less, respectively, and bladder compliance, as additional secondary outcomes (see Di erences between protocol and review). Madeiro reported four-arm comparisons including placebo; bethanechol alone given mg orally every eight hours; cisapride alone given mg orally every eight hours; and a combination of mg of bethanechol and cisapride given orally every eight hours.As cisapride has been restricted in the USA and Europe due to its serious side e ects, including cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heart rhythms) and death, we, therefore, included only the data obtained from participants allocated to placebo and bethanechol alone in the analyses. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. No data were reported for this outcome. No data were reported for this outcome. Flow rate at one month a er surgery among participants receiving bethanechol was higher than that noted among participants allocated to placebo (MD ., % CI . to .; participants; Analysis .). The maximum flow rate at one month a er surgery among participants receiving bethanechol was higher compared to those who were assigned to the placebo group (MD ., % CI . to .; participants; Analysis .). Participants receiving bethanechol had a lower risk of having a low maximum flow rate than those given placebo (RR ., % . to .; participants; Analysis .). Detrusor pressure at maximum flow, assessed at one month a er surgery among participants receiving bethanechol was higher than that noted among participants receiving placebo (MD ., % CI . to .; participants; Analysis .). Participants receiving bethanechol had a lower risk of encountering low detrusor pressure at maximum flow than those given placebo (RR ., % CI . to .; participants; Analysis .). See Di erences between protocol and review. The trial did not report poor bladder compliance but reported bladder compliance assessed at one month a er surgery.There was no di erence in bladder compliance evaluated at one month following surgery between the two comparison groups (MD ., % CI -. to .; participants; Analysis .). Four reports of Nwabineli , Suprasert , and Naik compared SPC versus ISC. None of the studies reported the rate of spontaneous voiding recovery one week a er surgery. Naik and their update report assessed QoL among participants at weeks, weeks and weeks a er surgery, using EORTC QLQ C questionnaires.The trial found no significant di erences between the two groups.Nevertheless, data were insu icient for calculating MD of QoL scores among the comparison groups. None of the studies reported this outcome.See Di erences between protocol and review.Suprasert , assessing participants, found that women given SPC went a longer time to a post-void residual urine volume of mL or less than women given ISC (MD . days, % CI . to .; Analysis .). See Di erences between protocol and review. Nwabineli and Naik reported time a er surgery to a post-void residual urine volume of mL or less.A meta-analysis assessing women showed that women given SPC went a shorter time a er surgery to a post-void residual urine volume of mL or less than women given ISC (MD -. days, % CI -. to -.; two studies, very low certainty evidence; Analysis .).The percentage of variability in e ect estimates due to heterogeneity rather than to chance was not important (I = %). Suprasert , assessing participants, reported acute complications a er surgery.The trial showed no di erence in risk of acute complications a er surgery (RR ., % CI . to .; very low certainty evidence; Analysis .) between participants who underwent SPC (four events in participants) and those who underwent ISC (six events in participants). None of the studies reported this outcome. In Nwabineli , of participants assigned to the SPC group and of participants assigned to the ISC group experienced urinary tract infection.In Suprasert , of participants and of participants assigned to the SPC and ISC groups, respectively, experienced urinary tract infection. A meta-analysis of Nwabineli and Suprasert , assessing participants, showed no di erence in risk of the rate of urinary tract infections during the first month a er surgery (RR ., % CI . to .; very low certainty evidence; Analysis .).The percentage of variability in e ect estimates due to heterogeneity rather than to chance was not important (I = %). Naik and their update publication reported subjective urinary symptoms using a urinary symptoms questionnaire (USQ).This trial found no di erences in terms of subjective urinary symptoms between participants undergoing suprapubic catheterisation and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews those who underwent intermittent self-catheterisation. Available data, however, were insu icient to calculate the relative measures of the e ect of interventions.We were unable to obtain additional data by contacting the authors of the trial. None of the studies under this comparison reported this outcome. None of the studies under this comparison reported this outcome. None of the studies under this comparison reported this outcome. None of the studies under this comparison reported this outcome. None of the studies under this comparison reported this outcome. None of the studies under this comparison reported this outcome. The findings of this review were based on five reports of four included studies (see Figure ).One trial compared bethanechol versus placebo (Madeiro ) .Three studies compared SPC versus ISC (Nwabineli ; Suprasert ; Naik ) . \\u2022 No information on the rate of spontaneous voiding recovery at one week following operation was reported in any of the included studies.QoL, adverse events, and subjective urinary symptoms were rarely assessed in the current evidence. We identified five published reports from four RCTs that included two comparisons of the interventions given to prevent bladder dysfunction a er radical hysterectomy for cervical cancer including bethanechol versus placebo and SPC versus ISC.The primary outcomes of this review were the rate of spontaneous voiding recovery at one week a er surgery and QoL.However, none of the studies reported the rate of spontaneous voiding recovery one week a er surgery.In addition, only one trial assessed QoL, but data were insu icient for assessing the e ect of the intervention. Applicability of evidence is limited by the quantity and certainty of the review results.The lack of data regarding primary outcomes of interest in almost all included studies and the very low certainty of available evidence may impede the applicability of the review findings.It is thus di icult to make any adequate judgements regarding the e ectiveness of the interventions assessed in this review.Additionally, it is important to note that the surgical techniques applied in almost all of the participants were conventional laparotomy radical hysterectomy.Therefore, the results may not be fully applicable to other surgical techniques (i.e.laparoscopic radical hysterectomy or nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy). In the protocol, we planned to assess the certainty of evidence by eleven relevant outcomes including the rate of spontaneous voiding recovery at one week a er surgery, QoL, time a er surgery to a post-void residual urine volume of mL or less, adverse events, post-void residual urine volume at one month a er surgery, rate of urinary tract infection in the first month a er surgery, and subjective urinary symptoms (Aue-aungkul ). As the review included only four studies, we obtained evidence from few studies and small number of participants for each comparison.Using GRADE assessments, we graded the certainty of the evidence as follows. \\u2022 Bethanechol versus placebo: information on post-void residual urine volume assessed at one month a er surgery was downgraded to very low certainty evidence due to important imprecision (combination of sparse data and a low number of events) and unclear risk of selection bias.No information on the rate of spontaneous voiding recovery at one week following the operation, QoL, adverse events, urinary tract infection in the first month a er surgery, and subjective urinary symptoms were reported under this comparison (see Summary of findings ). With assistance from the Information Specialist of the Cochrane Gynaecological, Neuro-oncology and Orphan Cancers Group, we were able to conduct a comprehensive literature search, including a search of the grey literature, conference proceedings and abstracts, citation lists of included studies, and registered databases of ongoing studies.In addition, bias was minimised in terms of the overall review process by following the recommendations in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins ) . As this review included only four studies, there remains the possibility of publication bias.We did not perform a funnel plot, as the analyses were limited to only one or two studies.Because of the small number of included studies, we did not carry out sensitivity and subgroup analyses as planned in the review protocol (Aueaungkul ).None of the review authors have any links to drug companies or financial interest in the prescription of the drug under evaluation, nor did they participate in the conduct of any of the included trials.Therefore, there were no known conflicts of interest of the authors of this review.Kietpeerakool recently reported a Cochrane Review and metaanalysis assessing the e ectiveness and potential harms of nervesparing radical hysterectomy in women with early-stage cervical cancer.Nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy is a modified surgical technique developed to permit surgical removal (resection) of oncologically relevant tissues surrounding the cervical cancer lesion while preserving pelvic autonomic nerves.This review noted that the nerve-sparing technique may lessen the risk of postoperative bladder dysfunction compared to the conventional radical hysterectomy.Nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy reduced postoperative bladder dysfunctions in terms of a shorter time to post-void residual urine volume of mL or less (mean di erence (MD) -. days, % CI -. to -.; low certainty evidence) and lower volume of post-void residual urine measured one month following operation (MD -. days, % CI -. to -.; low certainty evidence). To date, our review is the first systematic review evaluating the e ectiveness and safety of various postoperative interventions for preventing bladder dysfunction a er radical hysterectomy for early-stage cervical cancer.Limited evidence suggested that bethanechol may minimise the risk of bladder dysfunction a er radical hysterectomy by means of lower post-void residual urine volume assessed one month a er surgery and better results of urodynamic assessment.The e ectiveness of di erent types of postoperative urinary catheterisation (suprapubic and intermittent self-catheterisation), however, remained unproven by available evidence obtained from RCTs.In a retrospective cohort study conducted among women with early-stage cervical cancer who underwent radical hysterectomy, postoperative SPC was associated with shorter time to trial of voiding and lower urinary tract infection compared to transurethral catheterisation (Wells ). There are no RCTs assessing the e ectiveness of bladder training for preventing bladder dysfunction following radical hysterectomy with a focus on women with early-stage cervical cancer.Three reports of two RCTs assessing bladder training following radical hysterectomy which included women with early-stage and locally advanced-stage cervical cancer failed to note the e ectiveness of this intervention (Santaguida ; Fanfani ; Gong ).One RCT reported in Santaguida and Fanfani found that the median duration of time a er surgery to a post-void residual urine volume of mL or less was four days in the bladder training group (range day to days) and three days in the control group (range day to days).Gong reported no di erence in the risk of urinary tract infections during the first month a er surgery between the women assigned to bladder training (.%) and women in the control group (.%).Based on these findings, the e ectiveness of bladder training for preventing bladder dysfunction following radical hysterectomy for cervical cancer, therefore, remained unconfirmed. In general, the studies included in this review are very small, and thus make inferences challenging in the face of very low certainty evidence.None of the included studies reported the primary outcomes and various important secondary outcomes that this review aimed to assess (i.e.rate of spontaneous voiding recovery one week a er surgery, time to a post-void residual urine volume of mL or less, and post-void residual urine volumes at and months a er surgery. Very low-certainty evidence obtained from one small RCT indicated that bethanechol may minimise the risk of bladder dysfunction a er radical hysterectomy by means of lower post-void residual urine volume assessed at one month a er surgery and better results of the urodynamic assessment.However, there was a lack of data regarding clinically important outcomes (i.e.rate of spontaneous voiding recovery, QoL, adverse events, urinary tract infection, and subjective urinary symptoms).There was insu icient evidence to indicate whether SPC lessens the risk of bladder dysfunction following radical hysterectomy. In light of the results of this review, bethanechol may be an option for the treatment of bladder dysfunction following radical hysterectomy.However, the benefits and harms of this cholinomimetic drug need to be reassessed in further adequately powered, high-quality RCTs.If this pharmacological intervention can be shown to prevent bladder dysfunction, additional information regarding optimal dose and duration of treatment are required. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. In addition, particular attention should be paid to an assessment of a combination therapy with bethanechol and an alpha-adrenergic blocker, which was shown to be more e ective than bethanechol alone in a previous RCT conducted among patients with various causes of underactive bladder (Yamanishi ; Kim ). Importantly, any further studies should encompass an evaluation of the rate of spontaneous voiding recovery, QoL, time to a postvoid residual urine volume of mL or less, post-void residual urine volume, adverse events, and urinary tract infections which are clinically important outcomes for clinical-decision making.Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews -Quality of life (EORTC QLQ C) questionnaire at weeks, weeks and weeks following surgery Notes -The ISC protocol consisted of insertion of a transurethral indwelling catheter at the time of surgery which remained on free drainage until day , at which time it was withdrawn and the patient commenced ISC.ISC was continued until satisfactory frequency/volumes and RUVs were achieved (minimum mL of urine, at least four hourly during the day, with residual urine volumes of < mL). -The SPC protocol consisted of insertion of a Bonanno suprapubic catheter at the time of surgery followed by free drainage until day at which time it was clamped.Patients were then requested to pass urine at least every hours during the day following which the RUV was measured by releasing the clamp.SPC was continued until satisfactory frequency/volumes and RUVs as described above were achieved. During the operation, all patients had an indwelling free draining Foley's catheter. At the end of the operation, a Becton-Dickenson Bonanno catheter was inserted if randomisation had indicated a suprapubic catheter and the urethral catheter was removed.In those patients randomised to receive urethral catheters, this was le in situ. Trial of voiding started on the fi h postoperative day.Catheters were removed when the residual urine was \\u2264 mL.Antibiotics were not administered routinely in the postoperative period.Daily catheter specimens of urine were examined bacteriologically daily until the catheters were removed except in patients who went home with their catheters in situ. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Study duration: September to June Participants stage IB-IIA cervical cancer patients who underwent radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy (RHPL).At the end of the RHPL operation, the participants were allocated immediately into the intermittent self-catheterisation (N=) or the suprapubic catheterisation (N=) group before abdominal closure. Exclusion criteria included abnormal preoperative bladder function or urinary analysis, urinary tract infection more than times per year, history of renal stone, bladder calculi, urinary incontinence, intraoperative bowel or urinary tract complication, and inability to perform Intermittent self-catheterisation (ISC). -Control group: suprapubic catheterisation Suprapubic catheter was placed through a small bladder incision and exited through a separated skin incision.The catheter in this group was clamped on day postoperatively for hours and was released after self-voiding to check the post voiding residual (PVR) urine. -Intervention group: intermittent self-catheterisation (ISC) The ISC group was managed by indwelling transurethral Foley's catheter for days.On day , the patient was instructed to do ISC until she could confidently perform by herself.When the Foley's catheter was removed on day , the ISC was performed every hours after each voiding and the PVR urine was recorded. -In both groups, ISC and SPC were discontinued when the PVR was < ml for consecutive voids. Outcomes -Febrile morbidity -The voiding time (days) -Rate of urinary tract infection Notes -Urine analysis was performed weekly until the ISC or SPC was discontinued. -Bacteriuria was defined as urinary culture showed the organism more than colonies/mL. -Prolonged bladder dysfunction was defined as the voiding time was longer than days. -Febrile morbidity was defined as two consecutive oral temperatures \\u2265 \\u02da C, at least hours apart excluding the first hours after operation.Mean Difference IV, Random, % CI -.

Treatment modalities that help men with infertility achieve their goal of having a healthy child have undergone multiple stepwise advancements over the years-from assisted reproductive technology and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) to the use of microscopic sperm extraction techniques to diagnostic technologies such as whole-genome sequencing and sperm function testing () .Advancements such as microscopic sperm extraction have allowed physicians to be more efficient in collecting seminiferous tubules that are more likely to contain sperms (); however, laboratory tissue processing after microscopic collection remains a challenge because the process is currently performed manually; can require - hours of careful examination; and is dependent on the examiner's level of expertise, fatigue, and ability to visualize sperms () .The automation of this tedious process could facilitate greater efficiency of andrology laboratory personnel and supplement their initial searches, which could be especially helpful in cases of nonobstructive azoospermia (NOA).Lee et al. ( ) demonstrated this automation in their study; the investigators used a machine learning algorithm to detect rare sperm in microscopic testicular sperm extraction samples from men with NOA using bright-field microscopy.The investigators trained their convolutional neural network using bright-field images paired with fluorescenttagged sperm images to establish the ground truth before algorithm validation.Overall, the algorithm had .% sensitivity, with a % positive predictive value.Lee et al. ( ) demonstrated the ingenious use of machine learning technology to provide an additional tool for laboratory personnel while searching for sperms in men with NOA. Automation to identify sperms in the andrology laboratory could allow more efficient and more effective identification of rare sperms, which would be a substantial advancement in the field of male infertility.However, although sperm identification remains crucial, there are currently no nondestructive technologies or processes that allow the evaluation of the quality of the sperm after it is retrieved.The next breakthrough in sperm collection and processing will be the identification of the most viable sperm for use in ICSI or sperm selection.Embryo selection has undergone significant advancements over the years; the current modalities of embryo assessment rely either on embryo growth over a period of days and subsequent grading based on subjective morphology or destructive testing of nonessential cells in the trophectoderm (preimplantation genetic testing); neither of these options can be applied to sperm selection.As such, novel modalities for sperm selection will need to be developed; the most promising approach may be through nondestructive imaging techniques.Technologies such as Raman spectroscopy and quantitative phase imaging provide the ability to assess cellular contents, including aneuploidy, methylation, and DNA packaging, all of which could help identify sperms that can lead to the most optimal embryonic development () .As technologies such as machine learning to automate rare sperm identification become more widespread and potentially allow for the identification of a few rare sperms in men who previously had no sperms identified, the subsequent selection of the most optimal sperm for use in ICSI will become more and more essential.We believe that continued, stepwise advancements and wide implementation of these technologies will further help couples with infertility achieve their goal of a healthy child.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"summary\",\n

It can lead to severe health issues for some infected individuals and is responsible for significant disability and death among many, including men, women, and infants. Syphilis is most common during periods of high sexual activity, with an estimated global prevalence of about 0. 5% in women and 0. 3% in men. This translates to around 6 million new cases worldwide each year. The prevalence of syphilis in women also tends to decrease as a countrys average income rises. Diagnosis is based on clinical history, symptoms, and specific serologic tests.\n",
        "\n",
        "Two types of tests are used for diagnosis: treponemal and non-treponemal tests. Non-treponemal tests, such as VDRL or RPR, measure the body’s response to certain antigens but can yield false-positive or false-negative results. Limitations in resource-limited settings often hinder access to these tests. Therefore, rapid point-of-care tests that detect antibodies or antigens have become more popular in such contexts. These tests provide quick results, enabling immediate treatment without the need for extensive training and equipment. Rapid tests reduce treatment delays and the risk of untreated infections.\n",
        "\n",
        "The World Health Organization has set ASSURED criteria to improve syphilis testing, which means the tests should be affordable, sensitive, specific, user-friendly, rapid, robust, and equipment-free. Both treponemal and non-treponemal rapid tests exist, with combined tests showing varying sensitivity and specificity based on different study conditions. Implementing these rapid tests should come with systems to ensure quality and expertise. Access to timely diagnosis and treatment can significantly lower the disease burden.\n",
        "\n",
        "Testing at points of care is crucial, especially for symptomatic patients displaying signs of infection. Rapid tests can help confirm suspicions quickly, leading to prompt treatment and reduced transmission rates. High-quality systematic reviews of available rapid test evidence are essential for improving syphilis diagnosis. This will allow better decision-making at various healthcare levels.\n",
        "\n",
        "This systematic review aims to assess the accuracy of rapid tests in nonpregnant women and men of reproductive age, focusing on different types of tests based on infection stages and settings. Only studies with a valid diagnostic process, without case-control designs, will be included. The review will analyze a range of studies using electronic and manual search methods, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of test accuracy. The results will facilitate enhanced public health policies focused on timely diagnostics and treatment to reduce syphilis transmission. The systematic review will compare various tests and settings, identify accuracy differences, and adapt methodologies to address unique challenges in diagnostic testing.\n",
